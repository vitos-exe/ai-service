You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you



Bet you ain't know that I be checking you out

When you be putting your heels on

I swear your body's so perfect baby

How you work it baby yea

I love the way that you be poking it out

Girl give me something to feel on

So please believe we gone be twerking it out

By the end of the night baby



I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands

Around your waist and kiss your face

Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing

Not even for a minute

And I'll sit here long as it takes

To get you all alone

But as soon as you come walking my way

You gon hear me say



There goes my baby

(oo girl look at you)

You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

There goes my baby

Loving everything you do

Oo girl look at you



I get the chills whenever I see your face

And you in the place girl

Feel like I'm in a movie baby

I'm like oowee baby oh

Like waterfalls your hair falls down to your waist

Can I get a taste girl

No need to keep this baby

I ain't ashamed of calling your name girl



I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands

Around your waist and kiss your face

Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing

Not even for a minute

And I'll sit here long as it takes

To get you all alone

But as soon as you come walking my way

You gon hear me say



There goes my baby

(oo girl look at you)

You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

There goes my baby

Loving everything you do

Oo girl look at you



And girl I feel like it's our first time

Everytime we get together

Baby loving you feels better than

Everything, anything

Put on my heart you don't need a ring

And I promise our time away won't change my love

Oo girl look at you

And I'm standin' on the front line.
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life.
I will say I spent it with you.
If I wake up in the World War III.

I see destruction and poverty.

And I feel like I want to go home.

It's okay if you're coming with me.



Chorus: 



Cause your love is my love.

and my love is your love.

It would take an eternity to break us.

And the chains of Amistad couln't hold us.



If I lose my fame and fortune.

And I'm homeless on the street.

And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station.

It's okay if you're sleepin' with me.



As the years they pass us by.

we stay young through each other's eyes.

And no matter how old we get.

It's okay as long as I got you babe.

If I should die this very day.

Don't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay.

And no matter what people say.

I'll be waiting for you after judgement day.

7,7,Austra,Spellwork,angry,"Habit alone, when separate I moan.
Feeding on bones or anything grown.
I command post and nobody shows
in mornings I rest here,
in evenings I work here,
my debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left.

All I adore-



You must be the call

the evil at night

speaking words of grace

while spellwork delights.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.



I work alone saving my soul

if yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse.

Send me a sign, for my body's aligned.

I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face

my pores are wide open

and bleed for your potion,

spellwork and lies!



You must be the call

the evil at night

speaking words of grace

while spellwork delights.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.



You must be the call

the evil at night

speaking words of grace

while spellwork delights.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire."

I was messed up, dirty as I could be, 
I was on my way to hell; 
but I heard the preacher, 
preaching the Word of God, 
confess your sins and repent. 



[Chorus:]

I came to Jesus as I was, 

weary, worn, and sad. 

I found in Him a resting place 

and He has made, made me glad.



[Verse 2:]

I asked the Lord, 

?how could He love me, 

I have sinned against Your will?. 

But He said, ?repent and I will forgive you, 

the question's who will you serve?? 



[Verse 3:]

You might be dirty, messed up inside, 

You may even have lost your will to live; 

don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel, 

confess your sins and repent so you can be like me.

It's starting to fly.
See how the hands go;
Waving goodbye.
And you know I get so forgetful

when I look in your eyes.



Now she's walking backwards

through a parade.

And I'm stuck in the shadow

blocking the shade.



And there ain't no way to sweep up the mess that we've made

She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed



Flowers for the sick and dead

She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow

She'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes

and when the fog rises somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore



There's nothing to keep you

from falling in love.

It starts at the bottom

and comes from above.



Like pieces of a puzzle, like a hand in a glove

She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed



Flowers for the sick and dead

She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow

She'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes

and when the tide rises somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye"

To the real nitty gritty

You're hiding your love from me



Wanna know



Gotta know



You said I'd be the only one

That you'd be giving

Your sweet love to



Somebody else must be

Getting your love

'Cause loving me

You just don't do, no, no



You know I need it, baby



Tired of waiting

On your love now, baby

Where is your love



I'm hurting for

Your love now, baby

Don't tell me you're going

Back on your promises, baby

Oh, ho, oh, hey, hey, baby

Gonna give it to me

live a life that seems to be a lost reality 

that can never find a way to reach.

How deep can I go in the ground that I lay? 

If I don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind.

This time I look to see what's between the lines!

Game i inevitably lose 

Governed by laws set up by me 

Fracture it's jaw to let me be

Filled with an insubordinate race

Now your nightmare comes to life.
Dragged you down below
Down to the devils show

To be his guest forever

Peace of mind is less than never



Hate to twist your mind

But God ain't on your side

An old acquaintance severed

Burn the world your last endeavor



Flesh is burning

You can smell it in the air

Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal



So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head

Your now a slave until the end of time here



Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare

While your nightmare comes to life



Can't wake up in sweat

Cause it ain't over yet

Still dancing with your demons

Victim of your own creation



Beyond the will to fight

Where all that's wrong is right

Where hate don't need a reason

Loathing self-assassination



You've been lied to

Just to rape you of your sight

And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel



So sedated as they medicate your brain

And while you slowly go insane they tell ya

""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yeah

No one to call

Everybody to fear

Your tragic fate

Is looking so clear

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare



(Break)



(Maniacal laughter)

Fight. not to fail

Not to fall

Or you'll end up like the others



Die, die again

Drenched in sin

With no respect for another



Down, feel the fire

Feel the hate

Your pain is what we desire



Lost, hit the wall

Watch you crawl

Such a replaceable liar



And I know your hear their voices

Calling from above

And I know they may seem real

These signals of love

But our life's made up of choices

Some without appeal

They took for granted your soul

And it's ours now to steal



As your nightmare comes to life



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yea

No one to call

Everybody to fear

Your tragic fate

Is looking so clear

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare"

driven by the pain

Ever danced beside the devil?

Taste the barrel of a gauge?

Ever pull the trigger?

The light begins to fade

Feel life slipping away

I've asked you for your grace

I've asked you for your blessing

Dirty dirty word

You feel my skin, its dirt 



Drive me wild 

Remember when you blew my mind? 

Cut through me 

Living in the dirt 

These dogs are curled up in a little ball 

These dogs are freezing their asses off 



Go, go , go 

Pick up the pieces 

I wanna call this my home 

Go, go, go 

Pick up the pieces 

I've got some pain of my own 



Open the box 

See whats inside 

You make the call 

Sick of it all again

Pushing on my every nerve 

Scares me

That stained your concrete face for years

Crying, weeping, shedding strife

Year after year, life after life

A concrete angel laid right down

Upon the moon that swallows fast

It's peace at last

Oh, peace at last

Change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fucking lazy



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!

And I smell like shit



Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving

I sure as hell can't do it by myself

I'm feeling like a DOG IN HEAT

Barred indoors from the summer street

I locked the door to MY OWN CELL

And I lost the key



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!

And I smell like shit



I GOT NO MOTIVATION

WHERE IS MY MOTIVATION

NO TIME FOR THE MOTIVATION

SMOKING MY INSPIRATION



Sit around and watch the phone,but no one's calling

Call me pathetic,call me WHAT YOU WILL

My mother says to get a job

But she don't like the one SHE'S got

When mastur bation's lost its fun

You're fucking lazy



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn BORED

I'm going blind

And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes

I was slipping away to paradise

You keep this love, fist, scar, break

And the wars go on with brainwashed pride

For the love of God and our human rights

And all these things are swept aside

By bloody hands time can't deny

And are washed away by your genocide

And history hides the lies of our civil wars

D'you wear a black armband

When they shot the man

Who said ""Peace could last forever""

And in my first memories

They shot Kennedy

So I never fell for Vietnam

That you can't trust freedom

Look at the leaders we've followed

Look at the lies we've swallowed

And I don't want to hear no more

My hands are tied

For all I've seen has changed my mind

But still the wars go on as the years go by

With no love of God or human rights

'Cause all these dreams are swept aside

By bloody hands of the hypnotized

Who carry the cross of homicide

And history bears the scars of our civil wars

by some stupid fuck

And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin

With another sin

The bitch is hungry

She needs to tell

So give her inches

And feed her well

More days to come

New places to go

I've got to leave

It's time for a show



Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane



My body is burning

It starts to shout

Desire is coming

It breaks out loud

Lust is in cages

Till storm breaks loose

Just have to make it

With someone I choose

The night is calling

I have to go

The wolf is hungry

He runs the show

He's licking his lips

He's ready to win

On the hunt tonight

For love at first sting

Death and hatred to mankind,

poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!



Politicians hide themselves away

They only started the war

Why should they go out to fight?

They leave that role to the poor



Time will tell on their power minds

Making war just for fun

Treating people just like pawns in chess

Wait `till their judgement day comes, yeah!



Now in darkness, world stops turning,

as you hear the bodies burning.

No more war pigs of the power,

hand of god has struck the hour.

on their knees the war pigs crawling.

Begging mercy for their sins,

Satan, laughing, spreads his wings...Oh lord, yeah!"

Embedded deep under my skin

It could never be, the way it was before

If I can't hold on to you

Leave me somethin' I can hold onto

But right now baby let me pretend

That our love will never end

I get a constant busy signal
When I call you on the phone
I get a strong uneasy feeling
You're not sitting there alone
I'm having nasty, nasty visions
And baby you're in every one, yeah
And I'm so afraid I'm gonna find you with
A so-called smokin' gun

[Verse 2]
Maybe you want to end it
You've had your fill of my kind of fun
But you don't know how to tell me
And you know that I'm not that dumb
I put 2 and 1 together
And you know that's not an even sum
And I know just where to catch you with
That well known smokin' gun

And all the joy within you dies,
Don't you want somebody to love?

And your mind is so full of red,

Don't you want somebody to love?

Don't you need somebody to love?

Wouldn't you love somebody to love?

You better find somebody to love



Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his

But in your head baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is

Don't you want somebody to love?

Don't you need somebody to love?

Wouldn't you love somebody to love?

They know just where to go

When they need their lovin man

They know I do it for free

One more drink fool, will drown you

98,98,Jethro Tull,Locomotive Breath,sad,"In the shuffling madness
of the locomotive breath,
runs the all-time loser,
headlong to his death.
He feels the piston scraping 
steam breaking on his brow 

old Charlie stole the handle and

the train won't stop going 

no way to slow down.

He sees his children jumping off

at the stations one by one.

His woman and his best friend 

in bed and having fun.

He's crawling down the corridor

on his hands and knees 

old Charlie stole the handle and

the train won't stop going 

no way to slow down.

He hears the silence howling 

catches angels as they fall.

And the all-time winner

has got him by the balls.

He picks up Gideons Bible 

open at page one 

old Charlie stole the handle and

the train won't stop going 

no way to slow down"
