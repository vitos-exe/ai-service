Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on a state road map
That's where I was born & where I'll die
Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in a rat race
And these days that's a special way to fly



Down home where they know you by name and treat you like family

Down home a man's good word and a handshake are all you need

Folks know if they're fallin on hard times they can fall back on

Those of us raised up down home



In the corner of a hardware store

Gathered round a checker board

Old men telling lies & crowning kings

Kids drivin round the old town square

Tops rolled down in the cool nite air

Go & see what's shakin at the Dairy Queen



Down home where they know you by name and treat you like family

Down home a man's good word and a handshake are all you need

Folks know if they're fallin on hard times they can fall back on

Those of us raised up down home



When I was a boy I couldn't wait to leave this place

But now I wanna see my children raised



Down home

Down home

Folks know if they're fallin on hard times they can fall back on

Those of us raised up down home



Where they know you by name and treat you like family

Down Home a man's good word & a handshake are all you need

Folks know if they're fallin on hard times they can fall back on

Those of us raised up down home

Down home



Way down home

Down home

Down home

Way down home

Down home
