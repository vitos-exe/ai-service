Sit here on the stairs and listen to the nighttime as the daylight fades away
Such a haunting and familiar tune, when I hear it in the distance i can say that I'm home
Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me all alone
But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be

Because I am home



The north shore is where my father lives, I wear my red sox hat around the world with pride

But the berkshires are where my heart is and when i see them in the distance i could cry because I'm home



Massachusetts

Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me all alone

But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be

Because I'm home

Massachusetts

Where my hero teaches classes everyday and where my friends don't treat me different

It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay

Because I'm home
