She struts into the room well I don't know her but with a magnifying glance I just sort of looked her over hmm
We had a drink or two well maybe three and then suddenly she starts telling me her life story
She says baby if you wanna be my lover you better take me home
'cause it's a long long way to paradise and I'm still on my own
Told her that I came from Detroit city and I played guitar in a long haired rock and roll band
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice I said listen baby you really wouldn't understand

And I said baby if you wanna be my lover you better take me home

'cause it's a long long way to paradise and I'm still on my own on my own

Oh baby if you wanna be my lover you better take me home

'cause it's a long long way to paradise and I'm still on my own oh
