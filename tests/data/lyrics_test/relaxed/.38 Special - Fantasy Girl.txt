Lately I'm learnin
That so many yearnings are never to be
The childhood illusions are merely delusions of a girl that I see
In my minds eye
I see clearly a vision of how it could be

Me and my fantasy girl

Hold on to me

Be my fantasy girl

Don't set me free



Now I've had my share

Sometimes I swear that I've had enough

You end up in sorrow

Broken tomorrows, love can be tough



But my minds eye sees a vision of true love and how it should be

Me and my fantasy girl

Hold on to me

Be my fantasy girl

Don't set me free

Be my fantasy

Yeah yeah yeah

I see clearly a vision of how it could be, yeah

Be my fantasy

Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah

Be my fantasy girl

Hold on to me

Your my fantasy girl

Don't set me free

Be my fantasy girl

Hold on to me

Your my fantasy girl

Don't set me free

Yeah
