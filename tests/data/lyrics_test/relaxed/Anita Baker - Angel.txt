(Patrick Moten/Sandra Sully, Anita Baker)
If I could I'd give you the world
I'd wrap it up around you
Won't be satisfied with just a piece of this heart
My angel, oh angel

You're my angel, oh angel

Dreams are dreams - Some dreams come true

I found a real dream baby when I found you

You're so strong

But tender too

You're my angel, oh angel

You're my angel, oh angel



Love like ours is heaven sent

Each day a day to remember

I feel so safe

I feel secure with you

You give me love and keep right on giving

You fill me up baby with the joy of living

When things get tough I can always turn to you

You're my angel, oh angel

You're my angel



Love the way we touch

I love the way it feels

Everytime you're near me

My poor heart just won't keep still

No doubt about it that this love I feel is real

Ask me to go with you, you know I will

Hold me near, hold me tight

Only you can make it real

Only you can make it alright

Just let me know that I am special to you

My angel, oh angel

You're my angel, oh angel

You're my angel, oh angel

You're my angel, oh angel

You're my angel, oh angel
