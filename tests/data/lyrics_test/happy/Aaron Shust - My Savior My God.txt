I am not skilled to understand
What God has willed, what God has planned
I only know at His right hand
Stands one who is my Savior 
I take Him at His word and deed

Christ died to save me; this I read

And in my heart I find a need

Of Him to be my savior



That He would leave His place on high

And come for sinful man to die

You count it strange, so once did I

Before I knew my Savior 



Chorus (2x's) 

My Savior loves, My Savior lives

My Savior's always there for me

My God: He was, my God; He is

My God is always gonna be



Yes, living, dying, let me bring

My strength, my solace from this spring;

That He who lives to be my King

Once died to be my Savior



That He would leave His place on high

And come for sinful man to die

You count it strange, so once did I

Before I knew my Savior



Chorus (2x's) 



(Instrumental)



Chorus: (2x's)



My Savior loves, My Savior lives

My Savior loves, My Savior lives
