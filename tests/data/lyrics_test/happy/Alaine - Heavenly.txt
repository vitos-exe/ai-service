[Acapella:]
Baby you take me away 
[Intro:]
Sweet emotion 
Sweet devotion 

Baby you take me away 

Kiss me softly 

Love me slowly 

It's (heavenly) 

Like the sunrise 

Tender love eyes 

Baby I need you stay 

It's so (heavenly) 



[Chorus:]

Wooaahhhh 

You're my loved one 

Sent just for me 

Wooaahhh 

You're my angel 

So heavenly 

Wooaahhhh 

Reign your love down 

Reign down on me 

Oooohhhh 

Baby the love you give is so heavenly 



[Verse 1:]

Heavenly eyes see into my soul 

And for you 

I would climb any mountain 

And baby 

You know me 

More than anyone else 

Beside this gift that we're sharing 

No other one can compare it 

You touch me 

And take me to heaven 



[Chorus:]

Wooaahhhh 

You're my loved one 

Sent just for me 

Wooaahhh 

You're my angel 

So heavenly 

Wooaahhhh 

Reign your love down 

Reign down on me 

Oooohhhh 

Baby the love you give is so heavenly 



[Verse 2:]

Heavenly nights and mornings are passing 

Crazy in love ever lasting 

And all that you worries 

All I'm ever asking 

For life I will always love you 

You are the one I belong to 

And my heart is no heart without you 



[Chorus:]

Wooaahhhh 

You're my loved one 

Sent just for me 

Wooaahhh 

You're my angel 

So heavenly 

Wooaahhhh 

Reign your love down 

Reign down on me 

Oooohhhh 

Baby the love you give is so heavenly 



I found heaven, heaven, heaven on earth 

And I never, never desert you 

Promise I'll stay true 

(Oh oh) 

I found heaven, heaven, heaven in life 

And I've seen it, seen it with my own eyes 

It's real, so real, sooo real 



[Chorus:]

Wooaahhhh 

You're my loved one 

Sent just for me 

Wooaahhh 

You're my angel 

So heavenly 

Wooaahhhh 

Reign your love down 

Reign down on me 

Oooohhhh 

Baby the love you give is so heavenly
