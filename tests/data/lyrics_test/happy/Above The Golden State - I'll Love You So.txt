I feel the sun
It's returned again
To chase the cold
Far away

I'm not alone

To fight the world I'm in

You gave me hope

For better days



I was searching for a friend like no other

I never thought You'd come my way



Everything I give to You

I'll love You so

Everything I say or do

I'll love You so



Look where we've come

How could I ever forget

Before Your love

My heart was dead



And I was afraid

That my sun would set

But You stayed around

To lift my head



I was living my whole life undercover

Never dreamed I'd see Your face



Everything I give to You

I'll love You so

Everything I say or do

I'll love You so

Ooh, I'll love you so

Ooh, I'll love you so 



(I feel the sun)
