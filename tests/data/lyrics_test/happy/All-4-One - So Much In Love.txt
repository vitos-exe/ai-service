As we stroll along together
holding hands walking all along
so in love are we two
that we don't know what to do
so in love (do so in love)
in a world of our own (do so in love)

as we walk by the sea together

under stars twinkling high above

so in love are we two

no one else but me and you

so in love (do so in love)

so much in love (do so in love)

so in love (do so in love)

so much in love (do so in love)



we stroll along together

I tell you, i need you oh so much

I love, I love you my darling

can you tell it in my touch



as we walk down the aisle together

we will vow to be together till we die

so in love are we two

just can't wait to say I do

so in love (do so in love)

in a world of our own

(do so in love) so in love

(do so in love) are you and I

(do so in love)



baby, I hope you realize

that you mean so much to me

you're everything I ever wanted in a woman

to touch, to feel your body close to me

and i just want to hold you in my arms forever

can you (I love you baby) tell it in my touch



as we walk down the aisle together

we will vow to be together till we die

so in love are we two

are we two just can't wait to say I do



so in love (do so in love)

are you and I (do so in love)

so in love (do so in love)

are you and I (do so in love)

(do so in love) so in love

(do so in love) so in love

(do so in love) so in love

(do so in love) so in love
