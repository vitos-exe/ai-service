Since you been gone
I feel my life slipping away
I look to the sky
And everything is turnin' gray
All I made was one mistake
How much more will I have to pay

Why can't you think it over

Why can't you forget about the past



Chorus:



When love makes this sound babe

A heart needs a second chance

Don't put me down babe

Can't you see I love you

Since you been gone I've been in a trance

This heart needs a second chance

Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye



So this is love

Standing in the pouring rain

I fooled on you

But she never meant a thing

And I know I ain't got no right

To ask you to sympathize

But why can't you think it over

Why can't you forget the past



Chorus



I never loved her

I never needed her

She was willing and that's all there is to say

Don't forsake me

Please don't leave me now

A heart needs a second chance
