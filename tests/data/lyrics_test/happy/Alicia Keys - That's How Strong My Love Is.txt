Some people they call me crazy
for falling in love with you
well they can take me 
and lock me away baby
'cause there's nothing 
those bars can do



I'll be the rising moon 

after the setting sun

just to let you know 

you'll always have someone

I'll be the clearest day

when the rain is done

so you'll always know



through the shake of an earthquake

i will never fall

that's how strong my love is

like a ship through the storm

we can risk it all

that's how strong my love is



I used to feel kinda lonely

cause the world it can be so fake

and all that matters i'm telling you

is you and me only

and the fortress from love we'd make



I'll be the water you need 

in the desert land

just to let you know 

you'll always have my hand

i'll be the woman you need 

to be a better man

so you'll always know



through the shake of an earthquake

i will never fall

that's how strong my love is

like a ship through the storm

we can risk it all

that's how strong my love is



oh, can't nothing break us down

oh, 'cause we are heaven bound

like the mountain standing tall:

immovable; we're here to stay

oh, can't nothing get in the way



through the shake of an earthquake

i will never fall (i will never fall)

that's how strong my love is

(that's how strong my love is)

like a ship through the storm

we can risk it all (we can risk it all)

that's how strong my love is

(that love is)



through the deepest waters

i won't let you drown 

(I won't let you drown Ohh!)

that's how strong my love is 

(Oh that's how strong my love, 

my love, my love)

cause we're the moon in the sky

that will never come down 

(never come down)

that's how strong my love is 

(Oh that's how strong my love is)

that's how strong my love is

that's how strong my love is
