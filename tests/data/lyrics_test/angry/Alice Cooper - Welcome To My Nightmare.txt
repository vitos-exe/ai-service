Welcome to my nightmare I think you're gonna like it I think you're gonna feel like you belong
A nocturnal vacation unnecessary sedation you want to feel at home 'cause you belong
Welcome to my nightmare whoa oh oh oh
Welcome to my breakdown I hope I didn't scare you that's just the way we are when we come down
We sweat laugh and scream here 'cuz life is just a dream here you know inside you feel right at home here
Welcome to my breakdown whoa oh oh oh you're welcome to my nightmare yeah eh yeah eh

Welcome to my nightmare I think you're gonna like it I think you're gonna feel you belong
