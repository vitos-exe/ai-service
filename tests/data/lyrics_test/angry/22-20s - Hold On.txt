strangers in my back yard
selling you beliefs
danger in my empire
trouble on the streets
and I don't want to modernize

and I don't want to rearrange

I don't want to fix up

and I don't want to change



hold on to the things that you love

hold on to the things that you love

hold on



danger in the papers

danger in the magazines

sell you ideas

sell you false dreams



and I don't want to modernize

and I don't want to rearrange

I don't want to fix up

and I don't want to change



hold on to the things you can feel 

hold on to the things that are real

hold on



strangers in my back yard

selling you beliefs

danger in my empire

trouble on the streets



and I don't want to modernize

and I don't want to change

I don't want to fix up

I don't want to rearrange



hold on to the things you can feel 

hold on to the things that are real

hold on to the things that you love

hold on to the things that you love



hold on to the things you believe

hold on to the things that you see

hold on to the one that you love

hold on to the one that you love
