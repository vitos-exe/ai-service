Your cruel device,
Your blood like ice.
One look could kill,
My pain, your thrill.
I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)

I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop

I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)

I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison



You're poison runnin through my veins

You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains.



Your mouth, so hot

Your web, I'm caught

Your skin, so wet

Black lace on sweat



I hear you callin and it's needles and pins (and pins)

I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name

Don't wanna touch you, but you're under my skin (deep in)

I wanna kiss you, but your lips are venomous poison



You're poison runnin through my veins

You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains

Poison



One look (one look), could kill (could kill),

My pain, your thrill.



I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)

I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop

I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)

I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison



You're poison runnin through my veins

You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains

Poison



I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)

I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop

I wanna kiss you, but I wanna too much (too much)

I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison



Yeah

Well I don't wanna break these chains

Poison



Runnin deep inside my veins

Burnin deep inside my veins

Poison

I don't wanna break these chains
