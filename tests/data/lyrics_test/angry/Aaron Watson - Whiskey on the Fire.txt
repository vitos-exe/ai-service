he'll start drinkin, and he'll start thinkin about her
again, again and again
he musta brought the jukebox cause those old sad songs they just won't
end, they just won't end
his old broken heart, it still burns with desire

cause you cant put out an old flame

by pouring whiskey on the fire



chorus:

and tonight he'll make a toast to her memory

and then he'll take another shot of a 100 proof of misery

and his old broken heart still burns with desire

cause you cant put out an old flame

by pouring whiskey on the fire



his tears fall like rain but his pain just wont die down

cause theres another blaze thats brewin

as he buys another round



repeat chorus



he'll start drinkin, and he'll start thinkin about her

again
