Yeah you seem so civilized your mama's tryin' to run your life
Your daddy's tryin' to pick your wife oh no
Yeah you run around with all that hair they just don't like those rags you wear
You say I'm gonna pack up my stuff I'm gonna run away
And then she said you drive me nervous nervous and then I said 
You drive me nervous nervous nervous oh nervous nervous nervous nervous whoa whoa oh aah

You're out of state you're thrown in jail you ain't got the bread to pay the bail

Your mom and papa come up and said honey where did we fail

And then you scream you drive me nervous nervous and then I screamed 

You drive me nervous nervous nervous oh nervous nervous nervous nervous whoa whoa oh

You drive me n n n nervous n n n nervous you drive me nervous whoa
