If I were to say to you
"Can you keep a secret?"
Would you know just what to do
Or where to keep it?
Then I say "I love you,"
And the foul situation

"Hey girl, I thought we were

The right combination."



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target,

Blame Cupid, Cupid

You think you're smart

Stupid, Stupid



CHORUS:

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart

Shoot that poison arrow

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart

Shoot that poison arrow



No rhythm in cymbals

No tempo in drums

Love on arrival

She comes when she comes

Right on the target

But wide of the mark

What I thought was fire

Was only the spark



The sweetest melody is an unheard refrain

So lower your sights

Yeah but raise your aim

Raise you aim



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target,

Blame Cupid, Cupid

You think you're smart

Stupid, Stupid.



CHORUS



"I thought you loved me but it seems you don't care."

"I care enough to know I can never love you."



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target

Blame Cupid

You think you're smart

That's stupid

Right from the start

When you knew we would part



CHORUS



Shoot that poison arrow
