For fear my eyes are closed 
I'll shut this out no more 
Embrace this 
And become the catalyst 
And now it swells in me 

Smash all my defenses down 

I'll take this 

I'll let the fire consume me 



I will not fall 

I will not fail 

I pound the walls I shake the cage 

I will not fall 

I will not fail 

Let this fire consume me 



This burning passion 

It fills me with desire 

And it drives me and drives my cause 

I'm filled with reasons, but reason drive me further 

Disdain for disbelief 

Will stay this course 



Let the fire consume me 

Let the fire burn 

Let the courage run through me 

Let the fire burn
