I saw you star-ing at each other
I saw your eyes be-gin to glow
And I could tell you once were lov-er's
You ain't hidding nothing I don't know
There's an old flame, burning in your eyes

That tears can't drown, and make-up can't disguise

That old flame may not be stronger, but it's been burning longer

Than any spark I might have, started in your eyes



You said it ended when he left you

You say your love for him is gone

But those old memories still up set you

For I might be a memory before to long



There's an old flame, burning in your eyes

That tears can't drown, and make-up can't disguise

That old flame may not be stronger, but it's been burning longer

Than any spark I might have, started in your eyes



Cause there's an old flame, burning in your eyes
