Enslaved by warlords from far away lands 
Forced into a life of slavery 
Forced to fight your brothers for rulers so cruel 
A killer instinct your only escape 
Ferocious battle, you must fight to survive 
Each weapon an extension of your strength 

All victories add greatness to your name 

Fight to the death, there will be no surrender 

Your cunning must be afforded 

There will be no remorse for those who gamble with your fate 

Freedom, through killing strangers will it come 

You fight to live, freedom gained with every shiv 

You need to prove, prove your worth 

To ascend to the trial of champions 

Every fight a battle to the death 

Your fate lies in the hands of fools 

A meagre wager more precious than your life 

When the thumb comes down 

You know just what to do 

Kill kill kill 

It's your time do what must be done 

Every day you fight, every day you win 

Taking the life of the emperor 

The ultimate reward for surviving the trial 

You will not die in chains, a champion you are
