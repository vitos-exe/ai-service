Grab your gun 
time to go to hell
I'm no hero 
Guilty as charged 
Search and destroy 



Found my faith 

Living in sin 

I'm no Jesus but neither are you my friend 

I'm on hope above the broken dreams 

The simple answer is never what it seems 



A million little pieces we've broken into

A million little pieces I've stolen from you 

Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 



Sold my soul to heaven and to hell

Sick as my secrets but i'm never going to tell 

i'm to blame

Burden of my dreams 

a course of faith and a blessing i believe

I believe 

I believe 

I believe

Oh i believe (a million little pieces)

I believe 



Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 

Search and destroy



Let go 

Let go 

Let me go 

Let me go 

Let go 

Let go 

Let me go 



Search and destroy 

A million little pieces 

A million little pieces 

A million little pieces

search and destroy (a million little pieces )

A million little pieces 

A million little pieces 

A million little pieces 



Stolen from you 



Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 

Search and destroy 



A million little pieces 

A million little pieces to start
