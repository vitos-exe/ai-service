I'm fine don't believe it
You know me enough to know that's a lie
I'm close hard it is to say
To total this as I barely holding on
Chorus:

I need you now I need you don't turn away

I need you now please don't turn me away

I need you I need you



Out of here where I've been spinning

It's nearly impossible to slow down

One night of your company

Might be the only thing to keep me save



The clock is ticking and the fuse is turning

Can't keep wondering from what is coming

Don't turn me away don't turn me away



How many times have I come to you vulnerable like this?

I know you have the right to question but please don't ask

I need you now

The clock is ticking and the fuse is turning

Can't keep wondering from what is coming

Don't turn me away don't turn me away

Chorus



Can't keep wondering from what is coming
