Lonely I'm Mr Lonely,
I have nobody,
For my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody,
For my own

I'm so lonely...



Yo, this one here 

Goes out to all my players out there, man

You know, that got that one good girl, dog

That's always been there, man, like, 

Took all the bullshit

Then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave



Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night

And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side

Could've sworn I was dreamin'

For her I was fiendin'

So I had to take a little ride

Backtracking on these few years

Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad

Cause ever since my girl left me

My whole life came crashin', and I'm so...



Lonely (so lonely)

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

I have nobody (I have nobody)

For my own (to call my own)

Girl, I'm so lonely (so lonely)

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

I have nobody (I have nobody)

For my own (to call my own)

Girl, I'm so lonely...



Can't believe I had a girl like you

And I just let you walk right out of my life

After all I put you through

You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart

Baby, you a good girl and I had no right

I really wanna make things right 'cause

Without you in my life, girl

I'm so...



Lonely (so lonely)

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

I have nobody (I have nobody)

For my own (to call my own)

Girl, I'm so lonely (so lonely)

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

I have nobody (I have nobody)

For my own (to call my own)

Girl, I'm so lonely...



Been all about the world

Ain't never met a girl

That can take the things that you been through

Never thought the day would come

Where you would get up and run

And I would be out chasing you

Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be

Ain't no one on the globe I'd rather see

Than the girl of my dreams that made me be

So happy, but now so lonely



Lonely (so lonely)

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

I have nobody (I have nobody)

For my own (to call my own)

Girl, I'm so lonely (so lonely)

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

I have nobody (I have nobody)

For my own (to call my own)

Girl, I'm so lonely...



Never thought that I'd be alone

I didn't think you'd be gone this long

I just want you to call my phone

So stop playing, girl, and come on home

Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout

I want me and you to work it out

I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby

And it's driving me crazy, cause I'm so...



Lonely (so lonely)

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

I have nobody (I have nobody)

For my own (to call my own)

Girl, I'm so lonely (so lonely)

I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

For my own (to call my own)

Girl, I'm so lonely...
