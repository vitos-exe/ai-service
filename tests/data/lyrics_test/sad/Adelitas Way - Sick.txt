I'm so sick of me being sick of you
And the way you look, all the things you do
You drive me crazy, drive me crazy
Sick of being broke, can't pay the share
I'm about to snap, I can't handle that

I'm going crazy, going crazy



If you're sick like me, there's no stopping now

Try to break it up and just let it out

If I was sick like you, I would feed the fire

I would light it up then watch it all drop down



I'm so sick of my life it's the same old shit

Try to make it bend but it never gives

Look what you made me, what you made me



Well, I hate my boss, he's a little bitch

If he keeps it up, I'll make him quit

Or I'll go crazy, I'm going crazy



If you're sick like me, there's no stopping now

Try to break it up and just let it out

If I was sick like you, I would feed the fire

I would light it up then watch it all drop down

Then watch it all drop down



I'm so sick of me being sick of you

And the way you look, all the things you do

You drive me crazy, drive me crazy, yeah



If you're sick like me, there's no stopping now

Try to break it up and just let it out

If I was sick like you, I would feed the fire

I would light it up then watch it all drop down



If you're sick like me, there's no stopping now

There's no stopping now, watch it all drop down

If you're sick like me then you're sick like me
