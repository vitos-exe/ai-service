As I breathe this cold that confines me
It is I who hopes to bring light to this valley of death
Behind the shadows of lies
Brilliant beams converge now to blind me
I cannot feel shame nor regret but in the presence of death
When the vultures arrive

Slaves, your time of descent will come with us all

Pain the way of all flesh that withers to old

All that you dream will be forgotten

And burn with the kindred of souls

I am the seed who was begotten

To rot with the waste of this earth down below

Now burn with the kindred of souls

Your hopes have now aged and withered away

All that you dream will be forgotten

And burn with the kindred of souls

I am the seed who was begotten

To rot with the waste of his earth down below
