Listen when I say, when I say it's real
Real life goes undefined
Why must you be so miserable?
Everything you take, makes it more unreal
Real lies are undefined, how can this be so miserable?

Under the summer rain... I burned away...

Under the summer rain, Oh... You turned away...



Listen, I can make, make the sound a feel

Feel fine, I kiss the lies...Why must they be so kissable?

Listen as I break, break the former seal

For the sight shines suicide, when will we be invisible?



Under the summer rain... I burned away

Under the summer rain, Oh... We burned away

Under the summer rain... I burned away

Under the summer rain... You turned away



This is the fall; this is the long way down

And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small

This is the fall; this is the long way down

And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small...



Under the summer rain... I burned away

Under the summer rain... We burned away



Under the summer rain... I burned away

Under the summer rain... We burned away



Under the summer rain... I burned away

Under the summer rain... You turned, away...
