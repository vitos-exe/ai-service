(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you



Bet you ain't know that I be checking you out

When you be putting your heels on

I swear your body's so perfect baby

How you work it baby yea

I love the way that you be poking it out

Girl give me something to feel on

So please believe we gone be twerking it out

By the end of the night baby



I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands

Around your waist and kiss your face

Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing

Not even for a minute

And I'll sit here long as it takes

To get you all alone

But as soon as you come walking my way

You gon hear me say



There goes my baby

(oo girl look at you)

You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

There goes my baby

Loving everything you do

Oo girl look at you



I get the chills whenever I see your face

And you in the place girl

Feel like I'm in a movie baby

I'm like oowee baby oh

Like waterfalls your hair falls down to your waist

Can I get a taste girl

No need to keep this baby

I ain't ashamed of calling your name girl



I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands

Around your waist and kiss your face

Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing

Not even for a minute

And I'll sit here long as it takes

To get you all alone

But as soon as you come walking my way

You gon hear me say



There goes my baby

(oo girl look at you)

You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

There goes my baby

Loving everything you do

Oo girl look at you



And girl I feel like it's our first time

Everytime we get together

Baby loving you feels better than

Everything, anything

Put on my heart you don't need a ring

And I promise our time away won't change my love



There goes my baby

You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

There goes my baby

Loving everything you do

Oo girl look at you

5,Whitney Houston,My Love Is Your Love,happy,"If tomorrow is judgement day (sing mommy)
And I'm standin' on the front line.
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life.
I will say I spent it with you.
If I wake up in the World War III.

I see destruction and poverty.

And I feel like I want to go home.

It's okay if you're coming with me.



Chorus: 



Cause your love is my love.

and my love is your love.

It would take an eternity to break us.

And the chains of Amistad couln't hold us.



If I lose my fame and fortune.

And I'm homeless on the street.

And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station.

It's okay if you're sleepin' with me.



As the years they pass us by.

we stay young through each other's eyes.

And no matter how old we get.

It's okay as long as I got you babe.



(Chorus) 



If I should die this very day.

Don't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay.

And no matter what people say.

I'll be waiting for you after judgement day.

7,Austra,Spellwork,angry,"Habit alone, when separate I moan.
Feeding on bones or anything grown.
I command post and nobody shows
in mornings I rest here,
in evenings I work here,
my debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left.

All I adore-



You must be the call

the evil at night

speaking words of grace

while spellwork delights.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.



I work alone saving my soul

if yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse.

Send me a sign, for my body's aligned.

I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face

my pores are wide open

and bleed for your potion,

spellwork and lies!



You must be the call

the evil at night

speaking words of grace

while spellwork delights.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.



You must be the call

the evil at night

speaking words of grace

while spellwork delights.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire."
8,Coro,Can't Let You Go,happy,"I should have known you'd be this way 
Serves me right, to fall in love 
You brought me love then you took it back 
We had it all and that's a fact 
Love is a game that we all play 

There's one thing I've got to say 

I gave you my heart and I gave you my world 

I spent those lonely nights right here in the cold 

Every time you touch me my body starts to quiver 

All I want to do is love you all night long 



Chorus: 

Can't let you go my love 

It's you that I need 

You keep me wanting you 

You push my love aside

Can't realize 

Can't seem to buy it 

Now that you're gone 

Now that you're gone

Can't let you go my love 

You fit me like a glove 

'Cause when you hold me tight 

The feelings oh so right 

Just can't forget those times 

When you were mine, all mine 

This love I have for you is true 

So come back to the one who loves you 



I should have known that you'd be this way 

Serves me right to fall in love

I was messed up, dirty as I could be, 
I was on my way to hell; 
but I heard the preacher, 
preaching the Word of God, 
confess your sins and repent. 



[Chorus:]

I came to Jesus as I was, 

weary, worn, and sad. 

I found in Him a resting place 

and He has made, made me glad.



[Verse 2:]

I asked the Lord, 

?how could He love me, 

I have sinned against Your will?. 

But He said, ?repent and I will forgive you, 

the question's who will you serve?? 



[Verse 3:]

You might be dirty, messed up inside, 

You may even have lost your will to live; 

don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel, 

confess your sins and repent so you can be like me.

It's starting to fly.
See how the hands go;
Waving goodbye.
And you know I get so forgetful

when I look in your eyes.



Now she's walking backwards

through a parade.

And I'm stuck in the shadow

blocking the shade.



And there ain't no way to sweep up the mess that we've made

She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed



Flowers for the sick and dead

She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow

She'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes

and when the fog rises somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore



There's nothing to keep you

from falling in love.

It starts at the bottom

and comes from above.



Like pieces of a puzzle, like a hand in a glove

She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed



Flowers for the sick and dead

She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow

She'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes

and when the tide rises somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye"

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I journey to 

live a life that seems to be a lost reality 

that can never find a way to reach. 

My inner selfesteem is low. 

How deep can I go in the ground that I lay? 

If I don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind.

This time I look to see what's between the lines!

Raving impossibilities 



Engaged in crime i grasp my throat 

Enraged my mind starts to smoke 

Enforce a mental overload

My body fights for air 

The ripping of the tissue

Gravity's got my bones 

It pulls my flesh away 

The steam finally dissipates 

I make out my sweaty face 



Association that i choose 

Game i inevitably lose 

Governed by laws set up by me 

Fracture it's jaw to let me be 

A cut-out cardboard condo maze 

Filled with an insubordinate race 

Irrational youths stop to stare 

As music rubber hosed the air 



Engaged in crime i grasp my throat 

Enraged my mind starts to smoke 

Enforce a mental overload

Now your nightmare comes to life.
Dragged you down below
Down to the devils show

To be his guest forever

Peace of mind is less than never



Hate to twist your mind

But God ain't on your side

An old acquaintance severed

Burn the world your last endeavor



Flesh is burning

You can smell it in the air

Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal



So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head

Your now a slave until the end of time here



Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare

While your nightmare comes to life



Can't wake up in sweat

Cause it ain't over yet

Still dancing with your demons

Victim of your own creation



Beyond the will to fight

Where all that's wrong is right

Where hate don't need a reason

Loathing self-assassination



You've been lied to

Just to rape you of your sight

And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel



So sedated as they medicate your brain

And while you slowly go insane they tell ya

""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yeah

No one to call

Everybody to fear

Your tragic fate

Is looking so clear

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare



(Break)



(Maniacal laughter)

Fight. not to fail

Not to fall

Or you'll end up like the others



Die, die again

Drenched in sin

With no respect for another



Down, feel the fire

Feel the hate

Your pain is what we desire



Lost, hit the wall

Watch you crawl

Such a replaceable liar



And I know your hear their voices

Calling from above

And I know they may seem real

These signals of love

But our life's made up of choices

Some without appeal

They took for granted your soul

And it's ours now to steal



As your nightmare comes to life



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yea

No one to call

Everybody to fear

Your tragic fate

Is looking so clear

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare"

A head that's full of rage

Better believe it

Stand in the closet and scream with me

driven by the pain

Better believe it

down inside a grave?

Listen to the eulogy

a buyer on the hate



Ever danced beside the devil?

Taste the barrel of a gauge?

Ever pull the trigger?

The light begins to fade

Feel life slipping away

I've asked you for forgiveness

I've asked you for your grace

I've asked you for your blessing

I've asked that I be saved

Watch it happen from the box 
Mind wanders 
Dirty dirty word 
My dirthouse 
This is where it all comes down 

Look into my eye 

You feel my skin, its dirt 



Drive me wild 

Remember when you blew my mind? 

Cut through me 

Living in the dirt 

These dogs are curled up in a little ball 

These dogs are freezing their asses off 



Go, go , go 

Pick up the pieces 

I wanna call this my home 

Go, go, go 

Pick up the pieces 

I've got some pain of my own 



Open the box 

See whats inside 

You make the call 

Sick of it all again 



Tear me down 

Pushing on my every nerve 

Scares me 

I hope i don't get burnt 

Look closer 

Look into my dirty mind 

Feeling sick inside 

My blood has turned to fucking dirt"

That stained your concrete face for years

Crying, weeping, shedding strife

Year after year, life after life

A narrow freshly broken ground

A concrete angel laid right down

Upon the moon that swallows fast

It's peace at last

Oh, peace at last

Change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fucking lazy



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!

And I smell like shit



Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving

I sure as hell can't do it by myself

I'm feeling like a DOG IN HEAT

Barred indoors from the summer street

I locked the door to MY OWN CELL

And I lost the key



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!

And I smell like shit



I GOT NO MOTIVATION

WHERE IS MY MOTIVATION

NO TIME FOR THE MOTIVATION

SMOKING MY INSPIRATION



Sit around and watch the phone,but no one's calling

Call me pathetic,call me WHAT YOU WILL

My mother says to get a job

But she don't like the one SHE'S got

When mastur bation's lost its fun

You're fucking lazy



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn BORED

I'm going blind

And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes

I was slipping away to paradise

Painful and untrue 
I said I loved but I lied

Never ending pain, quickly ending life --

You keep this love, thing, child, toy 

You keep this love, fist, scar, break 

You keep this love 



I'd been the tempting one 

Stole her from herself

Her pain was life 

And sometimes I feel so sorry 

I regret this the hurting of you 

But you make me so unhappy

Look at your women crying

Look at your young men dying

Look at the hate we're breeding

Look at the fear we're feeding

Look at the lives we're leading

The way we've always done before

My hands are tied

The billions shift from side to side

And the wars go on with brainwashed pride

For the love of God and our human rights

And all these things are swept aside

By bloody hands time can't deny

And are washed away by your genocide

And history hides the lies of our civil wars

D'you wear a black armband

When they shot the man

Who said ""Peace could last forever""

And in my first memories

They shot Kennedy

An I went numb when I learned to see

So I never fell for Vietnam

We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all

That you can't trust freedom

when it's not in your hands

When everybody's fightin'

for their promised land

Look at the blood we're spilling

Look at the world we're killing

The way we've always done before

Look in the doubt we've wallowed

Look at the leaders we've followed

Look at the lies we've swallowed

And I don't want to hear no more

My hands are tied

For all I've seen has changed my mind

But still the wars go on as the years go by

With no love of God or human rights

'Cause all these dreams are swept aside

By bloody hands of the hypnotized

Who carry the cross of homicide

And history bears the scars of our civil wars

""We practice selective annihilation of mayors

and government officials

for example to create a vacuum

Then we fill that vacuum

as popular war advances.

understand I don't need the waste following me. 

When you say, when you say how it used to be, 

understand I don't need the waste following me. 



Winding it up. 

Twist It. Undone.

Winding it up. 

Twist It. Undone.



When you say, when you say

I want to know how the story goes 

and if the sad song writes about how much you know 

about what really happened. Obviously 

you've got a skewed view or you weren't present to see.



With a healthy dose of evident 

fabrication filling us in. 

I want to know where you're coming from 

and where you're going. Have you come undone? 

There's a vitamin in this tune. 

Do yourself a favor. Give yourself room.



When you say, when you say how it used to be, 

understand I don't need the waste following me. 

Aww!

When you say, when you say how it used to be, 

understand I don't need the waste following me. 

When you say, when you say how it used to be, 

understand I don't need the waste following me.

58,Pearl Jam,Why Go,relaxed,"she scratches a letter
into a wall made of stone

and counting

since they put her in this place

she's been diagnosed

by some stupid fuck

and mommy agrees

why go home?

why go home?

why go home...



she seems to be stronger

but what they want her to be is weak

she could just pretend

she could play the game

she could be another clone

Last night was shaking
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin

So what is wrong

With another sin

The bitch is hungry

She needs to tell

So give her inches

And feed her well

More days to come

New places to go

I've got to leave

It's time for a show



Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane



My body is burning

It starts to shout

Desire is coming

It breaks out loud

Lust is in cages

Till storm breaks loose

Just have to make it

With someone I choose

The night is calling

I have to go

The wolf is hungry

He runs the show

He's licking his lips

He's ready to win

On the hunt tonight

For love at first sting



Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

Evil minds that plot destruction,
sorcerers of death's construction.

as the war machine keeps turning.

Death and hatred to mankind,

poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!



Politicians hide themselves away

They only started the war

Why should they go out to fight?

They leave that role to the poor



Time will tell on their power minds

Making war just for fun

Treating people just like pawns in chess

Wait `till their judgement day comes, yeah!



Now in darkness, world stops turning,

as you hear the bodies burning.

No more war pigs of the power,

hand of god has struck the hour.

Day of judgement, god is calling, 

on their knees the war pigs crawling.

Begging mercy for their sins,

Satan, laughing, spreads his wings...Oh lord, yeah!"

Another cause for me to fight

Another fuse uncovered

Now, for me to light

My dedication

To all that I've sworn to protect

I carry out my orders

With not a regret

A declaration

Embedded deep under my skin

A permanent reminder

Of how we began

No hesitation

When I am commanding the strike

You need to know

That you're in for the fight of your life



You will be shown

How I've become....

Layin in the hammock where it's nice and breezy

Sleepin off the night before

This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses

Nothing to do but breathe all day

Until the big moon rises and it's time to play

Come along with me

But you always believed in me

Lie to me and tell me that you'll stay here tonight
Tell me that you'll never leave
Oh, and I'll just try to make believe
That everything, everything your telling me is true
Come on baby won't you just



Lie to me, go ahead and lie to me



Lie to me, it doesn't matter anymore

It could never be, the way it was before

If I can't hold on to you

Leave me somethin' I can hold onto

For just a little while won't you, won't you let me be



Oh, anyone can see

That you love him more than me

But right now baby let me pretend

That our love will never end



Lie to me, go ahead and lie to me"

If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues, cocaine.
When your day is done and you wanna run, cocaine.

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie, cocaine.



If your thing is gone and you wanna ride on, cocaine.

Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back, cocaine.

I get a constant busy signal
When I call you on the phone
I get a strong uneasy feeling
You're not sitting there alone
I'm having nasty, nasty visions
And baby you're in every one, yeah
And I'm so afraid I'm gonna find you with
A so-called smokin' gun

[Verse 2]
Maybe you want to end it
You've had your fill of my kind of fun
But you don't know how to tell me
And you know that I'm not that dumb
I put 2 and 1 together
And you know that's not an even sum
And I know just where to catch you with
That well known smokin' gun

I'm standing here bewildered
I can't remember just what I've done
I can hear the sirens whining
My eyes blinded by the sun
I know that I should be running
My heart's beating just like a drum

And all the joy within you dies,
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love



When the garden flowers baby are dead yes

And your mind is so full of red,

Don't you want somebody to love?

Don't you need somebody to love?

Wouldn't you love somebody to love?

You better find somebody to love



Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his

But in your head baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is

Don't you want somebody to love?

Don't you need somebody to love?

Wouldn't you love somebody to love?

You better find somebody to love



Tears are running, ah, running down your breast

And your friends baby they treat you like a guest

It makes a grown man cryin' cryin'

Won't you make my bed

The stroke of my hand

They know just where to go

When they need their lovin man

They know I do it for free

Can't you smell that smell 

Ooooh that smell

Angel of darkness is upon you 

Stuck a needle in your arm 

So take another toke, have a blow for your nose 

One more drink fool, will drown you

Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes 

Say you'll be all right come tomorrow

Can't you smell that smell 

Ooooh that smell

Hey, you're a fool you 

Stick them needles in your arm 

I know I been there before 

One little problem that confronts you 

Got a monkey on your back 

Just one more fix, Lord might do the trick 

One hell of a price for you to get your kicks

His woman and his best friend 

in bed and having fun.

He's crawling down the corridor

on his hands and knees

the train won't stop going 

no way to slow down.

He hears the silence howling 

catches angels as they fall.

And the all-time winner

The way the beach is kissed by the sea.

Can make it rain,

Love, Reign o'er me.

Love, Reign o'er me, Rain on me.



On the dry and dusty road,

The nights we spend apart alone.

I need to get back home to cool, cool rain.

I can't sleep and I lay and I think,

The night is hot and black as ink.

Oh God, I need a drink of cool, cool rain.



Only love,

Can bring the rain,

That makes you yearn to the sky.

Only love,

Can bring the rain,

That falls like tears from on high.

101,Billy Squier,In The Dark,sad,"Life isn't easy from the singular side
Down in the hole some emotions are hard to hide
It's your decision it's a chance that you take
It's on your head it's a habit that's hard to break
Do you need a friend would you tell no lies
Would you take me in are you lonely in the dark...



You never listen to the voices inside

They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide

You're never sure if the illusion is real

You pinch yourself but the mem'ries are all you feel

Can you break away from your alibis

Can you make a play will you meet me in the dark...



Don'tcha need me...hey, hey

Don'tcha need me...oh yea

Don'tcha leave me...hey, hey

Don'tcha need me...oh yea



You take no int'rest no opinion's too dear

You make the rounds and you try to be so sincere

You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams

You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene

Can you face the fire when you see me there

Can you feel the fire will you love me in the dark..."

119,Annie Lennox,Walking On Broken Glass,sad,"You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar honey if I can't have you
Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass



Walking on walking on broken glass



The sun's still shining in the big blue sky

But it don't mean nothing to me

Oh let the rain come down

Let the wind blow through me

I'm living in an empty room

With all the windows smashed

And I've got so little left to lose

That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass



Walking on walking on broken glass



And if you're trying to cut me down

You know that I might bleed

Cause if you're trying to cut me down

I know that you'll succeed

And if you want to hurt me

There's nothing left to fear

Cause if you want to hurt me

You're doing really well my dear



Now everyone of us was made to suffer

Everyone of us was made to weep

But we've been hurting one another

And now the pain has cut too deep...

So take me from the wreckage

Save me from the blast

Lift me up and take me back

Don't let me keep on walking...

Walking on broken glass



Walking on walking on broken glass"
120,Soft Cell,Tainted Love,happy,"Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain that you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere

And I've lost my light

For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night



Once I ran to you (I ran)

Now I'll run from you

This tainted love you've given

I give you all a boy could give you

Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Oh...tainted love

Tainted love



Now I know I've got to

Run away I've got to

Get away

You don't really want any more from me

To make things right

You need someone to hold you tight

And you think love is to pray

But I'm sorry I don't pray that way



Once I ran to you (I ran)

Now I'll run from you

This tainted love you've given

I give you all a boy could give you

Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Oh...tainted love

Tainted love



Don't touch me please

I cannot stand the way you tease

I love you though you hurt me so

Now I'm going to pack my things and go

Tainted love, tainted love (x2)

Touch me baby, tainted love (x2)

Tainted love (x3)"
121,Lenny Kravitz,Again,happy,"I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Now that you are walking right through my door
All of my life

Where have you been

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

And if that day comes

I know we could win

I wonder if I'll ever see you again



A sacred gift of heaven

For better worse wherever

And I would never let somebody break you down.

Until you cried... never



All of my life

Where have you been

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

And if that day comes

I know we could win

I wonder if I'll ever see you again



At every time, I've always known

That you where there, upon your throne

A lonely queen, without her king

I longed for you, my love forever



All of my life

Where have you been

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

And if that day comes

I know we could win

I wonder if I'll ever see you again



All of my life

Where have you been

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

And if that day comes

I know we could win

I wonder if I'll ever see you again



All of my life

Where have you been

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

And if that day comes

I know we could win

I wonder if I'll ever see you again



I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again"
122,Cyndi Lauper,Time After Time,sad,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories
Time after



Sometimes you picture me

I'm walking too far ahead

You're calling to me, I can't hear, what you've said

Then you say

Go slow

I fall behind

The second hand unwinds



If you're lost you can look and you will find me

Time after time

If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 

Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me

Time After Time

If you fall I will catch you

I'll be waiting

Time After Time 



After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray

Watching through windows

You're wondering if I'm OK

Secrets stolen

From deep inside

The drum beats out of time



If you're lost you can look and you will find me

Time after time

If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 

Time after time



You said 

Go slow

I fall behind

The second hand unwinds



If you're lost you can look and you will find me

Time after time

If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 

Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me

Time After Time

If you fall I will catch you

I'll be waiting

Er hatte Schulden, denn er trank, doch ihn liebten alle Frauen 

Und jede rief: Come on, rock me Amadeus 

Er war Superstar, er war populär, 

Er war so exaltiert, because er hatte Flair, 

Er war ein Virtuose, war ein Rockidol, 

Und alles rief: Come on, and rock me Amadeus!

Es war um 1780 und es war in Wien,

No plastic money anymore, die Banken gegen ihn,

Woher die Schulden kamen, war wohl jedermann bekannt,

Er war ein Mann der Frauen, Frauen liebten seinen Punk.

Er war zu exaltiert, genau das war sein Flair,

Er war ein Virtuose, war ein Rockidol,

und alles ruft noch heute: Come and rock me Amadeus!

And some other woman is lookin' like something that might be good for you

Go on believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you

I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you

It's only fear that makes you run

The demons that you're hiding from

When all your promises are gone I'm the only one



Please baby can't you see I'm trying to explain

I've been here before and I'm locking the door And I'm not going back again

Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away

You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow that holds you down today



Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone

by Howard Jones
I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that I don't
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you, but I don't mind

Why should I mind, Why should I mind



Chorus

What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway

What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway



Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear

Never worry never be sad

The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can

This is why I don't mind you doubting



And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be

The door always must be left unlocked

To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you

And not to spend the time just doubting

I love you whether or not you love me

I love you even if you think that I don't

Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you, but I don't mind

Why should I mind, Why should I mind



Chorus

What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway

What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway



Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear

Never worry never be sad

The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can

This is why I don't mind you doubting



And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be

The door always must be left unlocked

To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you

And not to spend the time just doubting"

Sell the house and go to school

Get a young girlfriend, daddy's jewel

A change would do you good

A change would do you good



God's little gift is on the rag

Poster girl posing in a fashion mag

Canine, feline, Jekyll and Hyde

Wear your fake fur on the inside

Queen of south beach, aging blues

Dinner's at six, wear your cement shoes

I thought you were singing your heart out to me

Your lips were syncing and now I see



A change would do you good

A change would do you good



Chasing dragons with plastic swords

Jack off Jimmy, everybody wants more

Scully and angel on the kitchen floor

And I'm calling Buddy on the ouija board

I've been thinking 'bout catching a train

Leave my phone machine by the radar range

Hello it's me, I'm not at home

If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone



A change would do you good

A change would do you good

Hello, it's me, I'm not at home

If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone



A change would do you good

A change would do you good"

I feel my life slipping away
I look to the sky
And everything is turnin' gray
All I made was one mistake
How much more will I have to pay

Why can't you think it over

Why can't you forget about the past



Chorus:



When love makes this sound babe

A heart needs a second chance

Don't put me down babe

Can't you see I love you

Since you been gone I've been in a trance

This heart needs a second chance

Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye



So this is love

Standing in the pouring rain

I fooled on you

But she never meant a thing

And I know I ain't got no right

To ask you to sympathize

But why can't you think it over

Why can't you forget the past

I never loved her

I never needed her

She was willing and that's all there is to say

Don't forsake me

Please don't leave me now

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm ridin' in your car
You turn on the radio
You're pullin' me close
I just say no
I say I don't like it
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire

[Verse 2]
Late at night
You're takin' me home
You say you want to stay
I say I wanna be alone
I say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire
[Bridge]
You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool
Well, your kisses, they burn, but my heart stays cool

[Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
Baby, you can bet
A love they couldn't deny
My words say split
But my words, they lie
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Ooh, fire
Hot kisses like fire
Burn me up with fire
I like what you're doing now, fire
Touchin' me with fire
Touchin' me, burning me with fire
Take me home with fire, now
Kisses like fire
Kisses like fire"
158,Duran Duran,A View To A Kill,angry,"Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside

A week is why, until we...



Dance into the fire

That fatal kiss is all we need

Dance into the fire

To fatal sounds of broken dreams

Dance into the fire

That fatal kiss is all we need

Dance into the fire



The choice for you is the view to a kill

Between the shades assassination standing still



Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body

First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain

A chance to find the phoenix for the flame

A chance to die, but can we...



Dance into the fire

That fatal kiss is all we need

Dance into the fire

To fatal sounds of broken dreams

Dance into the fire

That fatal kiss is all we need

Dance into the fire



When all we see is the view to a kill"

160,April Wine,Just Between You And Me,happy,"Time and time again I see
A love that seemed strong was not meant to be
Broken hearts don't always mend
Left too unsure to try love again
But, just between you and me

Baby, I know our love will be

Just between you and me

Always I know our love will be

Just between you and me



Lovers often seem to say

Hearts can be blind to love gone astray

Always it's the same old song

Someone's been hurt by a love that's gone wrong



Just between you and me

Baby, I know our love will be

Just between you and me

Always I know our love will be

Just between you

Just between you and me



Words are sometimes hard to find

The silence can be so unkind

You always help me find my way

The love that we share grows stronger each day



Just between you and me

Baby, I know our love will be

Just between you and me

Always I know our love will be

Seulement entre toi et moi

Means that our love will always be

Just between you and me

Baby, I know our love will be

Just between you

Just between you and me"

Was destiny to be fulfilled
It is in my hands, I must not fail
I must not fail
Even through the darkest days

This fire burns, always

This fire burns

Always



This is the broken ground

As the faith begins to rise

Turn away from yesterday

Tomorrow's in my eyes



Never more to be held down,

By the waves against me.

Never more to be cast aside 

This day is mine



Even through the darkest days

This fire burns, always

This fire burns

Always



I will not be denied, in this final hour

I will not be denied, this day is mine

This passion inside me is burning, is burning

This passion inside me is burning, is burning



Even through the darkest days

This fire burns, always

This fire burns

Aren't you tired of being weak?

Such rage that you could scream. 

All the stars right out of the sky

And destroy the prettiest starry night. 

every evening that I die.



I am exhumed just a little less human 

and a lot more bitter and cold. [x3]



I am exhumed.. just a little less human....

So much more bitter and cold... 



After all these images of pain, have cut right thru you,

I will kiss every scar, and weep you are not alone...

Then I'll show you that place in my chest 

where my heart still tries to beat.

And destroy the prettiest starry night.

168,Alkaline Trio,Burn,angry,"There's a lightning storm each and every night 
Crashing inside you like motorbikes 
We toss and turn, sleep so loud 
Grind the teeth in our empty mouths 
Our empty 


There's a forest fire burning bright 

Spreading quickly towards our last rights 

Nowhere to run, pointless to hide 

Just lay there and scream, pretending to try 

Pretending 



Intending to burn, pretending to fight it 

Everyone learns faster on fire 

Things took a turn, lost all desire 

You live and you burn 

You live and you burn 



This impending doom is left deep inside 

And it's haunting you each and every night 

Light starving wolves, drowning sheep 

We close our eyes, pretending to sleep 

Descending 



Intending to burn, pretending to fight it 

Everyone learns faster on fire 

Things took a turn, lost all desire 

You live and you burn 

You live and... 



Like hell, we are anxiously waiting 

Like hell burning silently strong 

Somehow we fell down by the wayside 

And somehow this hell is home 



As we burn, pretending to fight it 

Everyone learns faster on fire 

Things took a turn, lost all desire 

You live and you burn 

You live and 

Like hell, we are anxiously waiting 

Like hell burning silently strong 

Somehow we fell down by the wayside 

And somehow this hell is home 

Right now, this hell is my home"

Give me to the pain of LifeWar

Maybe 'cos you're all I'm livin' for

With every heartbeat I want you madly

It's in my blood to always love you more

Love you more



Oh my love again

What I say is true

Though it may sound plain

I love you



And it means more to me than life can offer

And if this isn't true love then I am sure

That after this love there'll be no other

Until the razor cuts"

I fell down down down

And the flames went higher

And it burns burns burns

That ring of fire

When hearts like ours meet

I before ya like a child

Oh, let the fire burn wild

173,Streetlight Manifesto,Sick And Sad,sad,"Sick and sad again,
sometimes I'd like the rain to end.
Sick and sad again,
sometimes I like to stand on my own two feet.
Went to the corner of second and main

but there was someone there who mentioned 

that they hoped it would rain forever, forever, 

so they could drown in peace. 



Went down to the Hodskin P.L. 

But there was nobody to answer 

when I rang the doorbell forever, 

forever. 

So now I'm sad all the time. 



Sick and sad again,

sometimes I'd like the rain to end. 

Sick and sad again,

sometimes I like to stand on my own two feet. 



Today was the day but she threw it all away 

and I could never understand 

'cause she was never one to play by the rules of the game 

her and me we're so the same. 



I try so hard and I never give in,

and I am never satisfied

until the day that I win against them. 

But I don't care I'll follow her to anywhere.



Sick and sad again,

sometimes I'd like the rain to end. 

Sick and sad again,

sometimes I like to stand on my own two feet.



Sick and sad again,

sometimes I'd like the rain to end. 

Sick and sad again,

sometimes I like to stand on my own two feet.



Sick and sad again,

sometimes I'd like the rain to end. 

Sick and sad again,

sometimes I like to stand on my own two feet.

Sometimes I like to stand on my own two feet."

Oh my mind's racing from chasing pirates. x2 



My mind's racin' from chasing pirates. x2

190,Sade,Never As Good As The First Time,relaxed,"Adu - Matthewman
Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
You're way just hope it feels right

Sometimes it comes and it goes

You take it ever so slow

And then you lose it, then it flows right to you

So we rely on the past

Special moments that last

Were they as tender as we dare to remember

Such a fine time as this

What could equal the bliss

The thrill of the first kiss

It'll blow right to you



It's never as good as the first time

Never as good as the first time



Good times they come and they go

Never going to know

It's like the weather

One day chicken next day feathers

The rose we remember

The thorns we forget

We'd love and leave

We never spend a minute on regret



It is a possibility

The more we know the less we see

Second time, second time is not quite what it seems

Natural as the way we came to be

Second time won't live up to the dream



It's never as good as the first time

Never as good as the first time





Natural as the way we came to be

Second time won't live up to the dream

Natural as the way we came to be

Second time is not quite what it seemed



It's never

As good as the first time

As the first time (Never as good as the first time)

The First time



Natural as the way we came to be

Second time won't live up to the dream

Natural as the way we came to be

Second time is not quite what it seemed



It's never

As good as the first time

As the first time (never as good as the first time)

The first time"
191,Chaka Khan,Through The Fire,angry,"(David Foster, Tom Keane and Cynthia Weil)
I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart

We're through before we start

But I believe that we've only just begun



When it's this good, there's no saying no

I want you so, I'm ready to go



[Chorus:]

Through the fire

To the limit, to the wall

For a chance to be with you

I'd gladly risk it all

Through the fire

Through whatever, come what may

For a chance at loving you

I'd take it all the way

Right down to the wire

Even through the fire



I know you're afraid of what you feel

You still need time to heal

And I can help if you'll only let me try

You touch me and something in me knew

What I could have with you

Well I'm not ready to kiss that dream goodbye



When it's this sweet, there's no saying no

I need you so, I'm ready to go



[Chorus]



Through the test of time



[Chorus]



Through the fire, to the limit

Through the fire, through whatever

Through the fire, to the limit

Through the fire, through whatever"

If time was running out
Couldn't love you more

Take me by the hand come on

Be my darling be the one

194,Sting,It's Probably Me,angry,"If the night turned cold 
And the stars looked down
And you hug yourself 
On the cold cold ground
You wake the morning 
In a stranger's coat

No-one would you see

You ask yourself, 'Who'd watch for me?'

My only friend, who could it be?

It's hard to say it

I hate to say it 

But it's probably me



When your belly's empty 

And the hunger's so real

And you're too proud to beg 

And too dumb to steal

You search the city 

For your only friend

No-one would you see

You ask yourself, 'Who could it be?'

A solitary voice to speak out and set me free

I hate to say it

I hate to say it 

But it's probably me



You're not the easiest person I ever got to know

And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show

Some would say 

I should let you go your way

You'll only make me cry

If there's one guy, just one guy

Who'd lay down his life for you and die

It's hard to say it

I hate to say it

But it's probably me



When the world's gone crazy, and it makes no sense

And there's only one voice that comes to your defence

And the jury's out 

And your eyes search the room

And one friendly face is all you need to see

If there's one guy, just one guy

Who'd lay down his life for you and die

It's hard to say it

I hate to say it

But it's probably me



I hate to say it

I hate to say

But it's probably me

I hate to say it

I hate to say

But it's probably me

I hate to say it

I hate to say

But it's probably me"

To enter my life, enter my life

I pray for someone good to come

Love is sweet and so divine

And I can't wait for my love life to shine

Can anybody tell me where I can find

Any love, any love?

I know there's someone waiting for me

To enter my life, Come into my life



Suddenly I'm up in clear blue skies

Lonely tears start to fill my eyes

I can weep, but I refuse to cry

To think love is strong

To keep holding on

Come into my life

I knew you were the one for me

I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat

When I lay eyes on you

I feel your whisper across the sea

I keep you with me in my heart

You make it easier when life gets hard

Lucky to have been where I have been

Lucky to be coming home again

Waiting for a love like this

Every time we say goodbye

I wish we had one more kiss

I'll wait for you I promise you, I will



I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend

Lucky to have been where I have been

Lucky to be coming home again

Lucky we're in love every way

Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed

Lucky to be coming home someday



And so I'm sailing through the sea

To an island where we'll meet

You'll hear the music fill the air

I'll put a flower in your hair

though the breezes through trees

Move so pretty you're all I see

As the world keeps spinning round

You hold me right here right now



I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend

Lucky to have been where I have been

Lucky to be coming home again

I'm lucky we're in love every way

Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed

Lucky to be coming home someday

I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night

And I think to myself what a wonderful world.



The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky

Are also on the faces of people going by

I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do

They're really saying I love you.



I hear babies crying, I watch them grow

They'll learn much more than I'll never know

And I think to myself what a wonderful world

Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world."

and sweet you roll

Touch your lips just so I know

In your eyes, love, it glows so

I'm bare-boned and crazy for you

When you come crash

into me, baby

And I come into you

In a boys dream

In a boys dream

If I've gone overboard

Then I'm begging you

to forgive me

In my haste

When I'm holding you so girl...

close to me 





Oh and you come crash

into me, baby

And I come into you

Hike up your skirt a little more

and show the world to me

Hike up your skirt a little more

and show your world to me

In a boys dream... In a boys dream 





Oh I watch you there

through the window

And I stare at you

You wear nothing but you

wear it so well

Tied up and twisted,

the way I'd like to be

For you, for me, come crash

into me"

And I've been keeping all the letters 

that I wrote to you, 

Each one a line or two 

I'm fine baby, how are you? 

I would send them but I know that it's just not enough 

My words were cold and flat 

And you deserve more than that 



Another aeroplane, another sunny place

I'm lucky, I know... 

but I wanna go home 

I've got to go home



Let me go home 



I'm just too far

From where you are

I wanna come home



And I feel just like I'm living 

someone else's life 

It's like I just stepped outside 

when everything was going right 

And I know just why you could not come along with me 

This was not your dream 

but you always believed in me... 



Another winter day 

Has come and gone away 

in either Paris or Rome

A million people I 

still feel alone

Can't you find something better to do?

Others' lives are the basis of your own 

Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth

Kill or be killed, that isn't me

Maybe it's you dying to be

Somebody else. Man of the year

But I am the one to take back the fear



Don't want anything taken away

Taken away from me

It's all that I believe



Message of hate, fading away

My love and my failures ?one in the same?

Now that I'm back, painfully clear

But I'll be the one to take back the fear



When it seems that everything was all a dream

Everything's not what it seems

Even I cannot believe in me easily"

So get up and fight, get up and fight
You've had all your life to run and hide
Now step up, now step up, let's do this
Second round, going down
How about a little reaction, man?
You can barely stand
Bitch slap, slow attack
Man, that was practically suicide
Next in line
Go, fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
'Cause it's time to remember it
War
This is war and it's on tonight
So get up and fight, get up and fight
You've had all your life to run and hide
Now step up, now step up, let's do this
'Cause we're all about ready to break
And we're all about ready to break
Yeah, we're all about ready to break
Yeah, we're all about ready to break
This is war and it never ends
So get up, get up, get up, get up
You've had all your life to run and hide
Step up, now step up
This is war and it never ends
This is war and it never ends
This is war
Let's do this, let's do this
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
Let's do this"
212,Flyleaf,I'm So Sick,sad,"I will break into your thoughts
With what's written on my heart
I will break, break
I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live

Let me live without this

Empty bliss, selfishness

I'm so sick

I'm so sick



If you want more of this

We can push out, sell out, die out

So you'll shut up

And stay sleeping

With my screaming in your itching ears



I'm so sick, infected with

Where I live

Let me live without this

Empty bliss, selfishness

I'm so sick

I'm so sick



Hear it, I'm screaming it

You're heeding to it now

Hear it, I'm screaming it

You tremble at this sound



You sink into my clothes

This invasion makes me feel

Worthless, hopeless, sick



I'm so sick, infected with

Where I live

Let me live without this

Empty bliss, selfishness

I'm so, I'm so sick



I'm so sick, infected with

Where I live

Let me live without this

Empty bliss, selfishness

Guess I'll never have a fan

This will mean me to me

I could never have a seam

It's a neverending dream

I will always want to faint

If I'm me you'll never know

Everything I ever know

Free



It's another point of view

Look at me when I was you

I could never die again

I won't lose another friend

She will see another me

When I'm through I'll meditate

Guess I'll know I'll medicate

Guess I'll fall and medicate

This'll never open hate

For me is here to say



Me

I will never promise you

Why give up, why give in?

It's not enough, it never is.

So I will go on until the end.

We've become desolate.

It's not enough, it never is.

So I will go on until the end.



Surround me, it's easy to fall apart completely. I feel you creeping up again. 



It's over, no longer, I feel it growing colder. I knew this day would come to end, so let this life

begin.

Darlin' you can trust me completely

If you even try to look the other way

I think that I could kill this time

Rah!, Rah!



It doesn't really seem I'm getting through to you

Though I see you weeping so sweetly

I think that you might have to take another taste

A little bit of hell this time

Is she not right?

Is she insane?

Will she now

Run for her life in the battle that ends this day

Is she not right?

Is she insane?

Will she now run for her life

Now that she lied to me



You always wanted people to remember you

To leave your little mark on society

Don't you know your wish

Is coming true today?

Another victim dies tonight



Rah!, Rah!

Lie to me

Rah!, Rah!

Lie to me



Is she not right?

Is she insane?

Run for her life in the battle that ends this day

We're looking for you to start up a fight

This is the end, we won't take any more 

Say goodbye to the world you live in 

You have always been taking but now you're giving

Hiding, you will pay 

Dying, one thousand deaths

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill 

And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled 

There is only one thing on our minds 

Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find

219,Red,Death Of Me,sad,"I should have seen those signs all around me,
But I was comfortable inside these wounds;
So go ahead and take another piece of me now
While we all bow down to you;
You tear me down and then you pick me up,

You take it all and still it's not enough,

You try to tell me you can heal me,

But I'm still bleeding and you'll be 

The death of me!



How can you end my affliction

If you're the sickness and I'm the cure?

Too long I've faked this addiction,

Another sacrifice to make us pure;



You tear me down and then you pick me up,

You take it all and still it's not enough,

You try to tell me you can heal me,

But I'm still bleeding and you'll be 

The death of me!



You tear me down and then you pick me up,

You take it all and still it's not enough,

You try to tell me you can heal me,

But I'm still bleeding and you'll be 

The death of me!



I won't forget;

I cannot forget this;

I won't forget;

I'll never forget this;

I won't forget;

I cannot forget this;

I won't forget;

I'll never forget this;



I won't forget!

I cannot forget this!

I won't forget!

I'll never forget!



You know I can never prove this solution;

You aren't the one that I thought you were;

And so I learn to embrace this illusion,

The line that separates- it starts to blur;



You tear me down and then you pick me up,

You take it all and say it's not enough,

You try to tell me you can heal me,

But I'm still bleeding and you'll be 

The death of me!



And you'll be the death of me!



I will not forget!

I cannot forget this!

And you'll be the death of me!

221,Smashing Pumpkins,Disarm,angry,"Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn 


I used to be a little boy

So old in my shoes

And what i choose is my choice

What's a boy supposed to do?

The killer in me is the killer in you

My love

I send this smile over to you



Disarm you with a smile

And leave you like they left me here

To wither in denial

The bitterness of one who's left alone

Ooh, the years burn

Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn



I used to be a little boy

So old in my shoes

And what I choose is my voice

What's a boy supposed to do?

The killer in me is the killer in you

My love

I send this smile over to you



The killer in me is the killer in you

Send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you

Send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you

Send this smile over to you"
222,Soundgarden,Rusty Cage,sad,"You wired me awake 
And hit me with a hand of broken nails 
You tied my lead and pulled my chain 
To watch my blood begin to boil 
But I'm gonna break 
I'm gonna break my 

I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run 

Too cold to start a fire 

I'm burning diesel burning dinosaur bones 

I'll take the river down to still water 

And ride a pack of dogs 

I'm gonna break 

I'm gonna break my 

I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run 

Hits like a Phillips head 

Into my brain 

It's gonna be too dark 

To sleep again 

Cutting my teeth on bars 

And rusty chains, I'm gonna break my 

Rusty cage and run 

When the forest burns 

Along the road 

Like God's eyes 

In my headlights 

When the dogs are looking 

For their bones 

And it's raining icepicks 

On your steel shore 

I'm gonna break 

I'm gonna break my 

I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run"
223,Silverchair,Tomorrow,sad,"It's twelve o'clock, and it's a wonderful day. 
I know you hate me, but I'll ask anyway. 
Won't you come with me, to a place in a little town. 
The only way to get there's to go straight down. 
There's no bathroom, and there is no sink. 
The water out of the tap is very, hard to drink, 

Very hard to drink. 



You, wait 'til tomorrow 

You, wait 'til tomorrow 



You say that money, isn't everything, 

But I'd like to see you live without it. 

You think you can keep on going living like a king. 

Oohh babe, but I strongly doubt it. 



Very hard to drink. 



You gonna wait 'til, fat boy, 

Fat boy, wait until tomorrow"
224,Rage Against The Machine,Bombtrack,angry,"It's just another bombtrack 
And suckas be thinkin' that they can fade it 
But I'm going to drop it at a higher level 
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down 
Hand out some beat-downs 
Cold runna train on punk ho's that 

Think they run the game 

But I learned to burn that bridge and delete 

Those who compete at a level that's obsolete 

Instead I warm my hands on the flames of the flag 

As I recall our downfall 

And the business' that burned us all 

See through the news and views that twist reality 

Enough 

I call the bluff 

Manifest destiny 



Landlords and power whores 

On my people they took turns 

Dispute the suits I ignite 

And then watch 'em burn 



The thoughts of a militant mind 

Hardline, hardline after hardline 



Landlords and power whores 

On my people they took turns 

Dispute the suits I ignite 

And then watch 'em burn 





Chorus: 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 



Another funky radical bombtrack 

Started as a sketch in my notebook 

But now dope hooks make punks take another look 

My thoughts youhear and you begin to fear 

That ya card will get pulled if you interfere 

With the thoughts of a militant mind 

Hardline, hardline after hardline 



Landlords and power whores 

On my people they took turns 

Dispute the suits I ignite 

And then watch 'em burn

233,Mary J. Blige,Real Love,happy,"We are lovers through and through and though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realise I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration? Be the real love that I need
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



When I met you I just knew that you would take my heart and run

Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one

So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of

And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true

I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind

But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong maybe I'll find a

Real love



So I've tried my best and prayed to God He'll send me someone real

To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel

Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all

Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



See I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go

Been around the world and high and low and still I never know

How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around

Gotta end it in this way cause it seems he can't be found



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love"

Uhhh, I like it like that, she working that back, I don't know how to act,

Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me,



[Verse 1 (Soulja Slim)]

I'm a dick thrower, her neck and her back hurting,

Cut throat will have her like a brand new virgin,

Its like when she gets used of it, then you start serving,

Hop on top and start jiggy-jiggy jerking,

Slow down for me, you moving too fast,

My fingers keep slipping, I'm trying to grip that ass,

Keep being hard headed and I'ma make you get on me,

Got a human up disguise but my face is a doggy,

If You loving my ball, let me bury my bone,

I got four or five bad married bitches at home

One of my bitches fell in love with that outside dick,

That outside dick keep them hoes sick, like

[Verse 2 (Juvenile)]

Its like I got the world in my palm, your girl up under my arm

She fucked up from the charm,

She love the way the dick still hard from 12 till early in the morn,

fine bitches if you listening you heared me i'm strong,

If you going through your cycle I ain't with it i'm gone,

you must've heared about them hoes that I beat up in my home,

They wasn't telling the truth baby you know they was wrong,

Now, make it official and drink some of that Dom,

I don't mind buying blue, you riding too, don't be asking a nigga question bout where I'm driving you,

Lil mamma my shit together I ain't jiving you,

I don't think that nigga could do you better than I could do, you know

The Juvenile from cross the street by the derby,

Same nigga used to be runnin' with Rusty and Kirby,

Can a playa from tha nolia get a chance with it,

but I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

Slow Motion, she open, I'm hopin' she don't leave my dick broken,

And just don't holla out my name like we was all in,

Yo pussy throwback, and you know that,

So stop stunt'n, slow motion for a real nigga, 

I'm gone off that incredible potion and i'ma deal with you



[Juvenile]

I like how them Victoria Secrets sit in that ass,

Lemme pour some more hyp and hennesy in ya glass,

Would I be violating, If I grabbed me handfull,

I'm knowing whats happening, all I want is a sample,

Who you wit ? I'm in a rental today,

Its going down and happening and I remember the way,

Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed

Whats it gonna take for you to come in slow motion with me like,

tal vez un poco inclinado al loco beso,
me encantaría enamorar tu corazón.
Me encantaría ser el motivo de que se te escape el sueño,
que sea mi nombre el que llene tu cuaderno,

de cada olvido quiero ser yo tu razón.



Me encantaría ser tu alegría,

ser tu mayor motivación de cada día,

el que en tu cama beba tus ganas

como el que bebe solo en fines de semana.



Me encantaría estar de planta en tu vida

ser tu eterno seductor sin despedida.



Me encantaría ya no tener que aguantarme mis deseos

cuando he sufriendo solo porque no te veo,

me encantaría fueras mía de una vez.



Me encantaría ya no tener que esconderme para verte,

por ser tu amante desde ahora y para siempre

sería capaz de lo que fuera, ya lo ves.



Me encantaría ser tu alegría,

ser tu mayor motivación de cada día,

las que faltan las tienen tus ojos

si el destino te trajo hasta mi

tal vez fue por castigo de dios

cuatro espadas que hoy me hacen sufrir

nos tendran que matar a los dos



que te cuesta volver a ser buena 

si bien puedes seguirme adorando 

y con una mirrara curarme 

cuatro eridas que hoy sigen sangrando

Porque no les tienes miedo

Esperando a sota de oros

Se aparece un caballero

Dispense mi buen amigo

Esque yo llegué primero



El que no lo quiera creer

Que le entre a lo pantera

Pierde dinero y mujer

Y hasta la portamonedas

Y a veces llega a su casa

Con la camisa de fuera



Y ni modo de reclamos

Porque yo llegé a caballo

Estoy regando el rosal

Pa cortar la flor de mayo

Perdoneme rey de copas

Pero yo soy de a caballo



Y si juegas sin malicia

Porque no les tienes miedo

Esperando a sota de oros

Se aparece un caballero

Dispense mi buen amigo

You're committed to the process that makes me like You

And I feel like I can dance

Oh You make me want to dance

Not when I'm good enough

Not when I clean my act up

Not when I cross that line the thousandth time

And become a better man

And they're fighting down on Seventh Street

But life was not meant to be lived this way

'Cause it's true for every man and woman

Every boy and girl

That our only hope for living here together in this world



Is love, love, love, love, love

It's all about love, love, love, love, love

To know the love of our Creator

And to give the love He's given us away

On the plane, on my brain, 'bout to do the sho'

40k contract, take it out the do'

Dice, symbolise my life, roll 'em on the flo'

From your grubby hands, as you hand the grand stand

You live a shitty life, we live a bon, bon vie

Cruel world is fittin', they got us all hittin'

With late night divisions, and lab app decisions

But based with decisions, to fight a fricasse

And you've clearly decided, on how to handle me

Difficile, immbocile, is it fake, is it real

Are we dying on our feet, are we trying in our sleep

There's a rumour goin' 'round, 'bout the suits runnin' town

If you look into the sky, them birds fly high, high, high



Numbers, you got that number

You're looking outwards, and don't see the big picture

Over your shoulder, you'll get no last words

Because it's too late, you've clipped your own wings (your own wings)

We climb the structure (you scale the ladder)

You build it higher (you make us madder)

We take our aim (so now we're bearin' off)

You perch above your nest ( _ in your charms)

261,Sting,I Hung My Head,sad,"Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bread on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land

The horse he kept running, the rider was dead

I hung my head, I hung my head



I set off running to wake from the dream

My brother's rifle went into the stream

I kept on running into the salt lands

And that's where they found me, my head in my hands

The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""

Then it came to me just what I had done

And all for no reason, just one piece of lead

I hung my head, I hung my head



Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there

I see the judge high up in his chair

""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind

And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""

I said ""I felt the power of death over life

I orphaned his children I widowed his wife

I beg their forgiveness I wish I was dead""

I hung my head, I hung my head



Early one morning with time to kill

I see the gallows up on the hill

And out in the distance a trick of the brain

I see a lone rider crossing the plain

He's come to fetch me to see what they done

We'll ride together til Kingdom come

I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead

I hung my head, I hung my head"

When did love become unmoving? 

When did love become unconsuming? 

Forgetting what the world has told me

You can have me 



If You're all You claim to be

So I will crawl upon my knees 

Just to know the joy of suffering 

I will love You enough to let go

CHORUS:

Our God is an awesome God

He reigns from heaven above

With wisdom, power, and love

Our God is an awesome God



And when the sky was starless 

In the void of the night

Our God is an awesome God

He spoke into the darkness

And created the light

Our God is an awesome God

Judgement and wrath he poured out on Sodom

Mercy and grace He gaves us at the cross

Ihope that we have not 

Too quickly forgotten that

Out God is an awesome God

But I know that words will hardly do
Miracles with signs and wonders
Aren't enough for me to prove to you
Don't you know I've always loved you

Even before there was time

Though you turn away

I'll tell you still

Don't you know I've always loved you

Than the one who gives his life to prove

That he would do anything

And that's what I'm going to do for you"

'Cause I believe that love is the answer

I believe love will find a way



Violence has spread worldwide and there's families on the streets

We sell drugs to children now, well why can't we just see

That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today

Money is our incentive now so that makes it ok

Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand"

Ve nada más lo que ha dejado,

294,Camilo Sesto,Tarde O Temprano,sad,"Quién no busca un amor 
cuando se enfrenta a la soledad 
quién no sueña despierto 
y cierra sus ojos a la realidad 
quién es del todo feliz 
y no pasó alguna noche sin dormir 

por algún amor o alguna ilusión. 

Quién no estrecha una mano 

cuando le ofrecen algo más que amistad 

quién no ha escrito jamás 

una carta de amor 

que no se atreve a mandar 

quién no importa la edad 

no tuvo un romance 

en un rincón de un pórtal 

y amó bajo el manto 

de la oscuridad. 



Tarde o temprano 

algún sueño se cumple 

y pasan los días 

sin que el cielo se nuble 

tarde o temprano 

hay alguna razón 

para abrir el corazón. 



Quién si es suyo el error 

no llama a quien ama y le pide perdón 

quién lo le falto el valor 

colgó el teléfono al oir su voz 

quién nunca lloró por algo 

o por alguien que no pudo alcanzar 

quién no es capaz de perdonar. 



Tarde o temprano 

algún sueño se cumple 

y pasan los días 

sin que el cielo se nuble 

tarde o temprano 

hay alguna razón 

para abrir el corazón. 



Tarde o temprano 

algún sueño se cumple 

y pasan los días 

sin que el cielo se nuble 

tarde o temprano 

hay alguna razón 

para abrir el corazón. 



Tarde o temprano 

algún sueño se cumple 

y pasan los días 

sin que el cielo se nuble 

tarde o temprano 

hay alguna razón 

para abrir el corazón"
295,Marco Antonio Solis,Amor En Silencio,sad,"Llega a mi vida y se abre una página nueva
en la noche incesante de la humanidad
busco ya entre la oscuridad
esa luz que me de libertad
mi llanto se deja escuchar
hoy es mi primer despertar.



Todo es tan grande y pequeño

descubro que hay sueños descubro miradas

que enfrían mi piel

veo del mundo lo bello y lo cruel

hay palabras que rompen mi hiel

pero donde existe el dolor

siempre hay una semilla de amor.



Amor en silencio

es vivir un momento a tiempo

amor en silencio

es un beso amar o dar perdón sin explicar

solo un alma desnuda esa dicha puede lograr.



Amor en silencio

es andar a favor del viento

amor en silencio

es de Dios la manera de enseñarnos la verdad

es ganar en la vida el amor con voluntad.



Y aprendí a callar porque creo que es mejor

pero hablan mis ojos en nombre del amor

hay palabras que muerden y hieren sin razón

pues lo mas grande y puro lo dice el corazón."
296,Vicente Fernandez,El Rey,sad,"Yo sé bien
que estoy afuera
pero el día
que yo
me muera
sé que tendrás

que llorar



(llorar y llorar

llorar y llorar)



Dirás que no

me quisistes

pero vas a estar

muy triste

y así te me vas

a quedar.



Con dinero

y sin dinero

yo hago siempre

lo que quiero

y mi palabra

es la ley



No tengo

trono ni reina

ni nadie

que

me comprenda

pero sigo siendo

el rey.



Una piedra

en el camino

me enseñó

que mi destino

era rodar y rodar



(rodar y rodar

rodar y rodar)



También me dijo

un arriero

que no hay

que llegar

primero

pero hay

que saber llegar.



Con dinero

y sin dinero

yo hago siempre

lo que quiero

y mi palabra

es la ley



No tengo

trono ni reina

ni nadie

que

me comprenda

pero sigo siendo

el rey."

Tiene un impedimento para esta boda
Que lo diga hoy o que calle para siempre

La iglesia estaba toda iluminada
Mucha gente fue invitada yo también estaba
Hay nadie sabe la tristeza que sentía
Porque justo en ese día se casaba mi querer

Ella llego acompañada del padrino
La llevaba a su destino que nunca imagino
Por un momento tuve toda la ilusión
De que en aquel anillo yo le daba el corazón

A la salida de la iglesia engalanada
Ella estaba ya casada la mujer que yo adore
Entre vivas de parientes y de amigos
Me acerque para desearle fuese siempre muy feliz

Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí

Que mala, que mala fuiste conmigo

Y todo enfrentar pero contigo
No puedes hacer con mis sentimientos
Un papel que lleva el viento
Que sube y que cae cuando quieres

Has dicho lo que me duele en el alma
Y eso era, que me mentías
Y te lo digo sin más orgullo
No te perdí por que nunca te tuve

Tampoco hay amor sinceró

es vivir sin tu amor



Duele mucho, duele el alma

302,Joan Sebastian,Sentimental,sad,"No, no es que extrañe tanto el sol de tu mirada
ni es que me falte el tierno roce de tu piel
sencillamente es que me canso de hacer nada
entonces tiendo a recordar, a recordar cosas de ayer
mas no se piense que vivir sin ti no puedo
hoy mi nostalgia tiene otra explicación

sencillamente es que me amaneció nublado

y el cielo gris, y el cielo gris siempre me pone el corazón

sentimental, sentimental



no, no es que extrañe tanto el dulce de tus besos

y hasta disfruto la amargura que hay en mi

en el asfalto no florecen los cerezos

hoy no hubo sol, hoy no hubo sol por eso es que estoy así

y no se piense que vivir sin ti no puedo

hoy mi nostalgia tiene otra explicación

sencillamente es que amaneció nublado

y el cielo gris, y el cielo gris siempre me pone el corazón

Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?
I'll get inside your groove 'cause I'm on fire, fire, fire, fire
It hurts when you get too close but, baby, it hurts
If love is really good, you just want more
Even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire

They don't compare to you
Don't be frightened, just give me a little bit more
They don't compare, all the lovers

Feel, can't you see there's so much here to feel?
Deep inside your heart, you know I'm real
Can't you see that this is going higher, higher, higher, higher?

You'll be next to me, it's all you need
And I'll take you there, I'll take you higher, higher, higher

When she's gone to a better place 
And loneliness will hurt you if you can't get through the night 
Then the moment starts to fade 
And dawn is just an hour away 
I feel she's watching over and it gets me through the night 



It makes me wonder what you'd say 

It's taking me back to the month of May 

When I watched you do it (all night) 

I'm thinking back to what we'd shared 

In many ways I'm already there 

And I watched you do it 



Don't turn the lights on 

Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 

Don't turn the lights on 

Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 

Don't turn the lights on 

Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 

Don't turn the lights on 

Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 



Another walk to take 

Another lonesome evening spent without you there 

And only those who hurt you 

Will say patience is a virtue 

And it's been so long 

And I can't think about it 

No, I can't figure it out 

It's just the way you're feeling 

Every time that you're appealing 

Leaves no room for doubt 



It makes me wonder what you'd say 

It's taking me back to the month of may 

When i watched you do it (all night) 

I'm thinking back to what we'd shared 

In many ways I'm already there

Don't turn the lights on

Don't turn the lights on 

Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 

Don't turn the lights on 

Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark

why can't they see they're just like me

it's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world



well i let their teeny minds think

that they're dealing with someone who is over the brink

and i dress this way just to keep them at bay

You came waltzing over to me
And Your eyes they saw right through me
And You heard each one of my cries for help
And You came to rescue me
I was broken

Every prayer that I had spoken

Reached Your ears and all my tears weren't cried in vain

You carried all my pain

And put me back together again

You watch over me in the darkest valleys

You watch over me when the night seems long

You help me to see the way before me

You watch over me; You watch over me

Always faithful

To be leading, at this moment

Interceding for Your children

Though I've wandered astray from Your infinite ways

You've never left me alone -[to chorus]

Take my frozen heart; awaken me

Never once have You forsaken me

Even though I walk through this shadow of death

You will guide and defend me

You'll guard and protect me

Even though I walk through this shadow of death

You will lead me home"

You were the King of Kings. 
Yeah You were, yeah You were.

Enthroned above all things. 

Angels and saints cry out. 



We join them as we sing glory to God, 

Glory to God, glory to God forever.

Glory to God forever, yeah. 



Creator, God you gave me breath 

So I could praise Your great

All my days. 

So let my whole life be a blazing offering, 

A life that shouts and sings 

For greatness of our King.

333,Sade,Somebody Already Broke My Heart,angry,"1 - You came along when I needed a savior
Someone to pull me through somehow
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

Somebody already broke my heart

Somebody already broke my heart



Here I am

So don't leave me stranded

On the end of a line

Hanging on the edge of a lie

I've been torn apart so many times 

I've been hurt so many times before

So be careful and be kind

If someone has to lose, I don't want to play

Somebody already broke my heart

No, no I can't go there again

Let me know that love is really real

And it seems to me

that I'm wrapped up in your love



Don't you know that I'm

""Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""
He walks on, doesn't look back

He pretends he can't hear her

Starts to whistle as he crosses the street

Seems embarrassed to be there



Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for

You and me in paradise

Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for you

You and me in paradise



Just think about it



She calls out to the man on the street

He can see she's been crying

She's got blisters on the soles of her feet

She can't walk but she's trying



Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for

You and me in paradise

Oh think twice, it's just another day for you

You and me in paradise



Just think about it



Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do

Oh lord, there must be something you can say



You can tell from the lines on her face

You can see that she's been there

Probably been moved on from every place

'Cos she didn't fit in there



Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for

You and me in paradise

Oh think twice, it's just another day for you

You and me in paradise



Just think about it

you love me no longer, I know
and maybe there is nothing
that I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
that I ought just stick to another man

a man that surely deserves me

but I think you do!



So I cry, and I pray and I beg



Love me love me

say that you love me

fool me fool me

go on and fool me

love me love me

pretend that you love me

leave me leave me

just say that you need me



So I cried, and I begged for you to

Love me love me

say that you love me

leave me leave me

just say that you need me

I can't care about anything but you



Lately I have desperately pondered,

spent my nights awake and I wonder

what I could have done in another way

to make you stay

Reason will not pledge a solution

I will end up lost in confusion

I don't care if you really care

as long as you don't go



So I cry, I pray and I beg



Love me love me

say that you love me

fool me fool me

go on and fool me

love me love me

pretend that you love me

leave me leave me

Just lose control and let your body give in,

To the beat,

Of your heart as my hand touches your skin,

Is this love

Or,

Just sexual desire,

We're gonna start a fire!

I remember dancing on the hotel's unmade bed.



So wake up, wake up dreaming,

And lie here with me,

So wake up, wake up dreaming,

And lie here with me.

Taking chances in the back of your car,

We burn and on my radio is ""Rockin' in a Free World,

S.O.S.

So obsessed,

Oh you make me such a mess,

Why can't this just last forever, why, why, why?

And lie here with me.

339,Dido,Hunter,relaxed,"With one light on in one room
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there
If you were a king up there on your throne
would you be wise enough to let me go

for this queen you think you own

Wants to be a hunter again

wants to see the world alone again

to take a chance on life again

so let me go



The unread book and painful look

the tv's on, the sound is down

One long pause

then you begin

oh look what the cat's brought in

If you were a king up there on your throne

would you be wise enough to let me go

for this queen you think you own

Wants to be a hunter again

wants to see the world alone again

to take a chance on life again

so let me go

let me leave



For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now

and I don't know what to say to you but I'll smile anyhow

and all the time I'm thinking, thinking



I want to be a hunter again

want to see the world alone again

to take a chance on life again

so let me go."

Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone



These wounds won't seem to heal

This pain is just too real

There's just too much that 

time cannot erase



When you cried I'd wipe away 

all of your tears

When you'd scream I'd fight away 

all of your fears

I held your hand through 

all of these years

But you still have

All of me



You used to captivate me

By your resonating light

Now I'm bound by the life 

you left behind

Your face it haunts

My once pleasant dreams

Your voice it chased away

All the sanity in me



These wounds won't seem to heal

This pain is just too real

There's just too much that 

time cannot erase



When you cried I'd wipe away

When you'd scream I'd fight away

I held your hand through

But you still have

that you're gone

But though you're still with me

I've been alone all along

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know it's gonna make it that much better

When we can say goodnight and stay together



Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up

In the morning when the day is new

And after having spent the day together

Hold each other close the whole night through



Happy times together we've been spending

I wish that every kiss was neverending

Wouldn't it be nice



Maybe if we think and wish an hope and pray it might come true

Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do

We could be married

And then we'd be happy



Wouldn't it be nice



You know it seems the more we talk about it

It only makes it worse to live without it

But let's talk about it

Wouldn't it be nice"

Cause they've never really gone.

Just an old fashioned love song

Coming down in three part harmony.

Just an old fashioned love song

One I'm sure they wrote for you and me,

To weave our dreams upon and

Listen to each evening when the light are low.

To underscore our love affair

With tenderness and feeling

That we've come to know.

You'll swear you've heard it before

I bet her mama never told her why 

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl 
She's been living in her white bread world 
As long as anyone with hot blood can 
And now she's looking for a downtown man 
That's what I am 

And when she knows what
She wants from her time 
And when she wakes up

And makes up her mind 

She'll see I'm not so tough 
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl 
You know I've seen her in her uptown world 
She's getting tired of her high class toys 
And all her presents from her uptown boys 
She's got a choice 

Oooh...

Uptown girl 
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls 
But maybe someday when my ship comes in 
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been 
And then I'll win 


And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough 
Just because
I'm in love
With and uptown girl 
She's been living in her white bread world 
As long as anyone with hot blood can 
And now she's looking for a downtown man 
That's what I am 

Oooh...

She's my uptown girl 

You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl

Some forever not for better

Some are dead and some are living

In my life I've loved them all



But of all these friends and lovers

There is no one compares with you

And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life I love you more

But she was so much like a child
A devil when she held me close
An angel when she smiled
She always held it deep inside
But somehow I always knew

She'd go away when the grass turned green

And the sky turned baby blue



Chorus:

Baby blue

Was the color of her eyes

Baby blue

Like the Colorado skies

Like a breath of spring she came and left

And I still don't know why

So, here's to you and whoever

Holds my baby blue tonight



She brought color to my life

That my eyes have never touched

When she taught me how to care

I've never cared so much

I try not to think of her

But I fall asleep and do

And go away where the grass turns green

And the sky is baby blue

Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries ChorusSpoken: Then I awake and look around me, at four grey walls surrounding me and I realize yes I was only dreaming. For there´s a guard and there´s a sad old padre - arm in arm we walk at daybreak. Again I touch the green green grass of home.

Gotta come down again.

And the dream of peace comes true.

And the gasoline car is gone.

When an airplane flies without any fuel,

And the satellite heats our home.

One of these days when the air clears up,

And the sun comes shinin' through.

Underneath that sky of blue.

You don't have to get high to get happy,

Just think about what's in store.

Then they won't be booin' no more.

When a President goes through the White House door,

An' does what he says he'll do.

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.

Just call me angel of the morning angel

Maybe the sun's light will be dim

And it won't matter anyhow.

If morning's echo says we've sinned,

Well, it was what I wanted now.

And if we're the victims of the night,

I won't be blinded by light.



Just call me angel of the morning angel

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.

Just call me angel of the morning angel

Then slowly turn away,

I won't beg you to stay with me

Through the tears of the day,

Of the years, baby baby baby.

365,Willie Nelson,Always On My Mind,relaxed,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind



You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind



Maybe I didn't hold you

All those lonely, lonely times

And I guess I never told you

I'm so happy that you're mine

Little things I should have said and done

I just never took the time



You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind



Tell me, tell me that your

Sweet love hasn't died

And give me

Give me one more chance

To keep you satisfied

satisfied



Little things I should have

Said and done

I just never took the time



You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind"

Singin' hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Well now I go wild and dangerously but I've got plenty of company

When the moon comes up and the sun goes down

That's when I can to see the lights of town



I'm a honky tonk man...

I'm a honky tonk man...



Hey now a purty little gal and a jug of wine

That's what it takes to make a honky tonk mind

With the jukebox a moanin' honky tonk sound

Where I try to wash my troubles away

I'm still down and I'm still all alone

But it beats stayin' home all night long



Brother Jukebox...sister wine

Mother freedom...father of time

Since she left me by myself

You're the only family I've got left



I go home and I climb that old stairway

And I tell myself ""Tomorrow's a new day""

But I know I'll just go down again

And spend my time with my new next-of-kin

And I could let you down

Someday you'll say

There's always been a part of me

Feeling like my heart is so

Far away

Searching for a part of me

Looking for somebody to blame



Said you'd always be around

Then you leave it all out on the line

I'd tear it all down

Just to watch you change what you know was right



You were right there, I was lonely

And I could let you down

I need you to hear

Everything I wanted to say

I believe in nothing

One hundred suns until we part

I believe in nothing

Not in satan, not in god

I believe in nothing

Not in peace and not in war

I believe in nothing

But the truth of who we are

I give you all a boy could give you

Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Run away I've got to

Get away

Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Don't touch me please

I cannot stand the way you tease

I love you though you hurt me so

Now I'm going to pack my things and go

And in the night we'll wish this never ends

Comes creeping on so haunting every time

And as I stared I counted

The Webs from all the spiders

Catching things and eating their insides

Like indecision to call you

and hear your voice of treason

Will you come home and stop this pain tonight

Stop this pain tonight

Will they stop when they see us again?
I can't stop now I know who I am

[Chorus]
Now I'm all yours, I'm not afraid
And you're all mine, say what they may
And all your love, I'll take to the grave
And all my life starts
I'm all yours, I'm not afraid
And you're all mine, say what they may
And all your love, I'll take to the grave
And all my life starts, starts now"

Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerer of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh Lord Yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave peril to the poor, yeah

Time will tell on their empower minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'til their judgment day comes, yeah

Now in darkness world stops turning
As you hear the bodies burning
No more War Pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of judgment, God is calling
On their knees the War Pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins

Isolation is the oxygen mask you make

But I'm not a slave to a god 

that doesn't exist

But I'm not a slave to world 

that doesn't give a shit



And when we were good 

you just closed you eyes

So when we are bad

we're going to scar your minds



fight, fight, fight, fight



You'll never grow up to be a big-

rock-star-celebrated-victim-of-your-fame

They'll just cut our wrists like

cheap coupons and say that death

was on sale today



And when we were good

you just closed you eyes

So when we are bad

we're scar your minds

that doesn't exist

the death of one is a tragedy

388,Muse,Map Of The Problematique,sad,"Fear, and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I saw
Is being swept away
When I refuse to let you go



I can't get it right

Get it right

Since I met you



Loneliness be over

When will this loneliness be over



Life will flash before my eyes

So scattered almost

I want to touch the other side

And no one thinks they are to blame

Why can't we see

That when we bleed we bleed the same



I can't get it right

Get it right

Since I met you



Loneliness be over

When will this loneliness be over

Loneliness be over

When will this loneliness be over

Amigo que te pasa estas llorando
seguro es por destenes de mujeres
no hay golpe mas mortal para los hombres
que el llanto y el desprecio de esos seres

Amigo voy a darte un buen consejo

si quieres disfrutar se sus placeres

consigue una pistola si es que quieres

o comprate una daga si prefieres

y vuelvete asesino de mujeres

Mátalas

con una sobredosis de ternura

asfixialas con besos y dulzuras

contagialas de todas tus locuras

Mátalas

con flores con canciones no les falles

que no hay una mujer en este mundo

que pueda resistirse a los detalles

Despiertalas con una serenata

sin ser un día especial llevale flores

no importa si es la peor de las ingratas

que tu no eres un santo sin errores.

Amigo voy a darte un buen consejo

For the record I love you

I coudn't sleep thinking about

All the things that we've been through

Now all I want to do is tell you

That I miss you so much

Chorus



Now that I'm on my own

I know that in time I'll find somebody new

(Who'll treat me better than you)

So now that I'm all alone without you

But I still love you

You know I'll never live without you

So we can be together

You just don't understand the word ""love""

But now all we have is memories

desde que estas conmigo creo que ahora

y ahora voy caminando junto a ti, 

somos dos nunca sola vas a ir y ahora 

voy sonriendo junto a ti somos dos 

juntos vamos a vivir, pa pa pa pa pa 

pa pa paara pa pa pa pa pa paara.

voy pensando en ti cuando lejos estoy

la de octubre es más hermosa,
porque en ella se refleja la quietud

al arrullo de su plena juventud.



Corazón,

que has sentido el calor

de una linda mujer

en las noches de Octubre.

Corazón,

que has sabido sufrir

y has sabido querer

desafiando el dolor.



Hoy que empieza la vida,

tan sólo al pensar,

que tu amor se descubre.

El castigo de ayer

que me diste tan cruel

parece que murió.



Si me voy,

no perturbes jamás

la risueña ilusión

de mis sueños dorados.

Si me voy nunca pienses jamás

que es con el único fin

de estar lejos de ti.



Viviré con la eterna pasión que sentí,

desde el día en que te vi,

desde el día en que soñé

que serías para mí."

Away from home through no wish of my own 

That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely 

I wish that I could go back home 



Letters, never a letter 

I get no letters in the mail 

I've been forgotten, yes, forgotten 

Oh how I wonder, how is it I failed 



Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier 

Away from home through no wish of my own

No pudiste creerlo
Viniste a comprobarlo.
Que aquel que algún día te pidió por favor te marcharas
Hoy daría hasta el alma
Por que tu regresaras.

Es de humanos el equivocarse y pedir perdón

(aunque a veces duele más aceptarlo)

pero creo que yo he cometido mi peor error.

Ni juntando todas las tristezas de mi corazón...

Había llorado así

Había sufrido así

Siento que moriré sin ti

Nunca jamás había llorado así

Y estoy sufriendo como nunca antes sufrí

Y estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de 

sangre desde el día en que

Te vi partir.

Nunca jamás sentí tanto dolor

Es un puñal clavado aquí en mi corazón

Que me desgarra lentamente y me consume

Porque no tengo tu amor.

Es de humanos el equivocarse y pedir perdón

(aunque a veces duele más aceptarlo)

pero creo que yo he cometido mi peor error.

Ni juntando todas las tristezas de mi corazón...

Había llorado así

Había sufrido así

Siento que moriré sin ti.

Nunca jamás había llorado así

Y estoy sufriendo como nunca antes sufrí

Y estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de sangre 

desde el día en que

Te vi partir.

Nunca jamás sentí tanto dolor

Es un puñal clavado aquí en mi corazón

Que me desgarra y me consume poco a poco

Porque no tengo tu amor.

Siento que me estoy muriendo

Por la falta de tus besos

Nunca había llorado así...

Estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de sangre 

desde el día en que te vi partir.

Y ya no aguanto esta pena y así no puedo vivir

Y así no se puede vivir

Un corazón sin ti, Mi corazón sin ti se que se va a morir.

Vuelve

Que el dolor me mata y no quiero perderte

Pobre diablo!

Te han dicho que me han visto en la calle llorando."

There's a stranger in my house

Somebody here that I can't see

Stranger in my house

Somebody here trying to take her away from me



She sits staring out the window

A million miles away

And when I ask if she's all right

She never has too much to say

Is it somebody we both know

Or somebody she just met

Is she loving him in her mind

While she's lying here in my bed



There's a stranger in my house

Somebody here that I can't see

Stranger in my house

Somebody here trying to take her away from me



Suspicions lead to questions

And questions to alibis

Is it just my imagination

Or has her love turned into lies



There's a stranger in my house

Somebody's here that I can't see

Stranger in my house

Somebody here trying to take her away

Stranger in my house

Somebody's here that I can't see

Stranger in my house

Somebody here trying to take her away

Out in the wild life, a lot of people telling lies

Lookin' right in your eyes'

They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begin
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple

And only a strong love survives

I know they say that it's a fine line

Between giving up and giving in

But once your heart's been in it

You just can't forget it

It's like nothing that you've felt in your life



We got real love

Not infatuation

Our hearts' celebration

I love you

You are such a part of my life

That I can't remember me without you

And we've had our nights

We've had our share of fights

But we've never thought of giving it up



Oh, you and I we must be dreamers

'Cause we're making our dreams come true

I could spend my life

Just holding you so tight

And never, ever get enough



We got real love

Can't be wrong

[Flute, Piano, and Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna be leavin' at the break of dawn
Wish you could come but I don't need no woman taggin' along
Goin' sneak out that door, couldn't stand to see you cry
I'd stay another year if I saw a teardrop in your eye

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

[Verse 4]
I never had a damn thing but what I had, I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing I ever tried to get off my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder and I guess I always will

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong"

They say that I'm the kind of man who always speaks his mind
To me there's nothing stronger than the truth
You can ask me almost anything and I'll tell it like it is
But darling when they ask me about you

I tell it like it used to be when you were still in love with me
Before you got too used to me and wanted someone new
I tell it like it ought to be cause how it is, is killing me
When they ask about you and me, I tell it like it used to be

[Verse 2]
I wish that I was stronger
I could tell them that you're gone
But that's one thing that I may never do
If they want to hear about our love
And how it all went wrong
Then darling they'll just have to talk to you

And I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry, it's just that I
noticed you goin' out of your mind
It looks like were two of a kind

Chorus



Let's fall to pieces together

Why should we both fall apart

Let's fall to pieces together

Right here in each other's arms



Alone is much better together

When the worst is still yet to come

So let's share the rest, of the tears that are left

From two hearts that just came undone

Why should we go crazy alone



Chorus"

Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall

Come and lay down by my side

Till the early mornin' light

All I'm takin' is your time

Help me make it through the night



I don't care who's right or wrong

I don't try to understand

Let the devil take tomorrow

Lord tonight I need a friend



Yesterday is dead and gone

And tomorrow's out of sight

And it's sad to be alone"

It happens when you kiss me

Your kiss is warm and tender

Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies



Love is like a butterfly

Love makes your heart feel strange inside

Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing



Your laughter brings me sunshine

Everyday is spring time

And I am only happy when you are by my side

How precious is this love we share

How very precious, sweet and rare

Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies

She arrives in all her splendor
Each night at nine o'clock
Her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block

Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in

And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again



She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar

She rules this smokey kingdom

Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne

Now the jesters flock around her tryina_T to win her favors

To see which one will take the

Queen of the Silver Dollar home



Now her royal dress is satin

It's shabby and it's torn

The royal jewels are rhinestones

The shoes are scuffed and worn

Of the many roads she's been down,

And the places that she's seen

Well they all look at her and say God save the queen



Now the Queen of the Silver Dollar

Is not as haughty as she seems

She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams

But there's a man who found her

And he brought her to this world

He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl



Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar

I rule this smokey kingdom

Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne

Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors

To see which one will take the

Your car's going up in flames

And it's driving you crazy just thinking that maybe

Someone like me is to blame

What you thought true love would be

And she looked so good while you were under her hood

While your girlfriend was smiling at me

Verse 1
Don't even like to think about it
I don't now what I'd do without it
I only know I'd live and not breathe for your love

Baby you came to me in my time of need

When I needed you, you were there for me

Baby the love from you is what got me through

It's because of you I was able to

Give my heart again, you gave me



Chorus

Someone to love

Someone to touch

Someone to hold

Someone to know

(You gave me)

Someone to love

Someone to trust

Someone to hold

Oh someone to know, oh



Verse 2

I thought I'd never love again

I thought my life was over and

I didn't want to face or even see another day, baby

Suddenly from no where, baby you appeared

You dried my tears, you cared for me

Maybe your love for me, truly rescued me

It's because of you, I was able to

Fall in love again, you gave me



Chorus

Someone to love

Someone to touch

Someone to hold

For so long in my life, I wouldn't let love inside

But I swallowed my pride the day you arrived

And now with you by my side

Everything is alright

It's because of you I was able to

Give my heart again, (girl)

And you gave me someone to love

You gave me someone to love

You gave me someone to love

But I couldn't find the words

I'm alone again without you

Alone again without you

Alone again without you

Alone again without you



I said stay, but you turned away

Tried to say that it was me

I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp.
You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask.
And you know and I know that you ain't got long now to last.
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past.



You're standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall.

Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.

Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me and maul.

You know I'm helpless from your mesmerising cat call.



Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.

Don't you stray, don't fade away.

Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.

Don't you stray, from the narrow way.



I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there.

You're the Phantom of the Opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare.

You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air.

Haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair."

434,Black Sabbath,The Devil Cried,angry,"One fine day in Hell
The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to Glory
There are whispers between the screams

That this deed can be done

Even sinners must dream

And I can be the one to make the Devil cry



I can win this game

If all things come together

I know this sounds quite strange

I won't be smart, just clever



It's the law on the other side

Just the kill lets you run

And how many have tried?

I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry



At last my time has come

I must not give him pleasure

I can be the one

One chance or burn forever



So I told him about my pain

And the life I've been through

He just smiled and the laughter came

Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil cried



Tears from his eyes

Eyes of fire

And the Devil cried"
435,The Who,Long Live Rock,sad,"Down at the Astoria the scene was changing,
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating,
We were the first band to vomit in the bar,
And find the distance to the stage too far,
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock,
Rock is dead they say,

Long live rock.



Long live rock, I need it every night,

Long live rock, come on and join the line,

Long live rock, be it dead or alive.



People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving,

We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins,

Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong,

Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone,

Back in the pub the governor stops the clock,

Rock is dead, they say,

Long live rock.



Long live rock, I need it every night,

Long live rock, come on and join the line,

Long live rock, be it dead or alive.



Landslide, rocks are falling,

Falling down 'round our very heads,

We tried but you were yawning,

Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead.



The place is really jumping to the Hiwatt amps,

'Til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps,

In the blackout they dance right into the aisle,

And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles,

Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock,

Rock is dead, they say,

Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.



Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock,

Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.



Long live rock, I need it every night,

Long live rock, come on and join the line,

Long live rock, be it dead or alive"

Trucks still rolling through the early morning

You're leaving just a break

Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like

Coming home again

Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like

Coming home again

Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like



Year after year out on the road

It's great to be here to see you all

I know, for me it is like

Coming home



Day after day out on the road

There's no place too far that we wouldn't go

We go wherever you like

To rock 'n' roll



Jump on the seats, put your hands in the air

Give me a shout, let me hear you're out there

The wilder you scream for some more rock 'n' roll

The higher we'll go



Year after year out on the road

It's great to be here to rock you all

I know, for me it is like

Coming home

Like coming home..."

That you give good love to me baby 

So good, take this heart mine into your hands 

You give good love to me

Baby you give good love 



Never stopping, I was always searching 

For that perfect love 

The kind that girls like me dream of

Oh, I guess they'll never know
How a young heart really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love

Just because we're in our teens

Tell them all it isn't fair

To take away my only dream



I cry each night my tears for you

My tears are all in vain

I'll hope and I'll pray that maybe someday

You'll be back in my arms once again



Someone, help me, help me, help me please

Is the answer up above



How can I, how can I ever tell them

This is not of puppy love."

I can't do this thing called life without you here with me (Do this thing)

Created in this world to love
To hold, to feel
To breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love

I am in love with you (In love), you set me free (Yeah)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
(Can't do this thing, yeah)

Take the Gun,

I'm sweating now..

moving slow..

No time to think,

my turn to go..



And You can See

My Heart Beating..

You Can See it through my chest

Said I'm Terrified

but I'm Not leaving..

I know that I must

Pass This test



SO Just Pull The Trigger

Say a Prayer, to yourself

he says close your eyes

sometimes it helps

and then I Get, a Scary thought

that is here means he is never lost



And You can See

My Heart Beating

You Can See it through my chest

said I'm Terrified but

I'm Not leaving

know that I must

Pass This test

And My Life flashes before

my eyes

I'm wondering Will I ever see

another sunrise?

so many won't get the

chance to say goodbye

but it's too late to pick up

the value of my life



And You can See

My Heart Bleeding

You Can See it through my chest

Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye

Gone too soon



Shining, sparkling

And splendidly bright

Here one day

Gone one night



Like the loss of sunlight

On a cloudy afternoon

Gone too soon



Like a castle

Built upon a sandy beach

Gone too soon



Like a perfect flower

That is just beyond your reach

Gone too soon



Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight

Here one day

Gone one night



Like a sunset

Dying with the rising of the moon

Gone too soon

Gone too soon"

(I do swear that I'll aways be there. I'd give anything and everything and I will always care.Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow, for better or worse, I will love you withevery beat of my heart.) 
From this moment life has begun 
From this moment you are the one 

Right beside you is where I belong 

From this moment on 



From this moment I have been blessed 

I live only for your happiness 

And for your love I'd give my last breath 

From this moment on 



I give my hand to you with all my heart 

Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start 

You and I will never be apart 

My dreams came true because of you 



From this moment as long as I live 

I will love you, I promise you this 

There is nothing I wouldn't give 

From this moment on 



You're the reason I believe in love 

And you're the answer to my prayers from up above 

All we need is just the two of us 

My dreams came true because of you 



From this moment as long as I live 

I will love you, I promise you this 

From this moment 

I will love you as long as I live 

From this moment on"

My love is warmer than a smile
My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true is ever letting all their love come through

My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too

[Chorus]
Let my love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over

[Verse 3:Stevie Wonder, Julio Iglesias]
Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased

What's the problem I don't know 
Well maybe I'm in love (love)

I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it



How much longer will it take to cure this

Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love) 

Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love 



Come on, come on 

Turn a little faster

Come on, come on 

The world will follow after

Come on, come on 

Cause everybody's after love



So I said I'm a snowball running 

Running down into the spring that's coming all this love 

Melting under blue skies 

Belting out sunlight 

Shimmering love 



Well baby I surrender 

To the strawberry ice cream

Never ever end of all this love

Well I didn't mean to do it 

But there's no escaping your love



These lines of lightning 

Mean we're never alone, 

Never alone, no, no 



Come on, Come on

Move a little closer 

Come on, Come on

I want to hear you whisper

Come on, Come on 

Settle down inside my love



Come on, come on 

Jump a little higher

Come on, come on

If you feel a little lighter

Come on, come on 

We were once

Upon a time in love 



We're accidentally in love

A pillow and a gun

And if my secret dreams could be seen on screen

Then they'll be coming for this one



I'm so down Lord

better slow down Lord



Please Lord now forgive me

Even though I don't deserve

I never was too good and now

The first time she ignored me

But then I threw her on the floor

oriundo de Nuevo Leon
tenia apenas 19 años
su nombre: Jose Perez Leon
Tenia un primo lejano

que de mojado se fue

al poco tiempo le envio un telegrama

diciendo ven pronto Jose



Pues un trabajo le habian encontrando

distando algodon como el



Y se fue, Y se fue

ahogando el llanto en el adios

con su mujer

se fue

sin saber, que de ese viaje ya jamas iba a volver

pobre Jose



Cuando llego a la frontera

con Willy se entrevisto

en el pollero mas afamado

y astuto de la region

Le dijo Pepe hoy estas de suerte

mañana te cruzo yo



La madrugada de un viernes

en una vieja estacion

30 inocentes pagaban su cuota

entre ellos Jose Perez Leon

y sin dudarlo a todos metieron

en el interior de un bagon



El tren cruzo al otro lado

casi 7 horas despues

fue cuando el aire empezo a terminarse

y ya nada pudieron hacer

nadie escucho aquellos gritos de auxilio

y la puerta no quiso ceder



Uno por uno se fueron cayendo

y asi fallecio el buen Jose

Y se fue, Y se fue

a cruzar el cielo con sus ancias de crecer

se fue

sin saber que ya su esposa un hijo suyo iba a tener

pobre Jose



Asi termina la historia, no queda mas que contar

de otro paisano que arriesga la vida

y que muere como ilegal

de aquel Jose que mil sueños tenia y que a casa

jamas volvera."

476,Train,Cab,sad,"New York snow this time of year
There's nothing more beautiful to me
Except for you
Makin' my way uptown and down
Seein' familiar places, faces

In my pile of coffee grounds



The days are better the nights are still so lonely

Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road

Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road



Watchin' my breath rise in the sun

Pullin' myself in to make warm

Helplessly feel for my phone and drive away



This new rhythm I pursue

Is just my gettin' over you 

Tellin' myself that I need to



The days are better the nights are still so lonely

Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road

Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road



I'm still lookin' for -

Don't wanna say I -

To be alone



The days are better the nights are still so lonely

Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road

The days are better the nights are still so lonely

Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road

Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road"

While an old Love song is creeping into your head
And as your eyes just closed I could only guess

I spent twenty nine more trying to get home

Well I never got home, but I did what I did

And I got myself this house and you can't come in



I'm the queen of my castle, I'm the king of my room

Get out of this house

I got more than I need, more than I ever could use

Get out of this house



I spent seventeen years trying to save my soul

I spent twenty three more down in the hole

Now my soul is alright but I might get found out

I got myself this house now and I can't get out



If I see you again it will be in my head at the end of a cloud

If you see me again it will be in your head telling you to get out



You act like a baby, you talk like a fool

Get out of this house

Go back to your mama, go back to high school

Get out of this house



Go jump in the lake, go jump out the door

Get out of this house

Confusion is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
And I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, and I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after

My picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

I can recall a certain magic in your eyes

tan carnosa, tan sobrada

esa boca me dice mi cielo

me hace bailar, me hace la boca un mar

501,David Bisbal,Esclavo De Sus Besos,sad,"No me preguntes por qué
a veces la nombro por casualidad
y es que aún la recuerdo
y es que aún llevo dentro su forma de amar.
Una razón para tí
me pides motivos y una explicación

para no desterrarla

ahora y para siempre de mi corazón.



Yo soy así, y seguiré

vagando errante por tu piel

yo no podré

dar todo de mi

mientras que olvide a esa mujer.



Y sigo esclavo de sus besos

y sigo preso de mis miedos

hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión

en el que ésta obsesión

está apartándome de tí.

Y sigo esclavo de sus besos

y sigo preso de mis miedos

y sigo sin saber por qué razón

ella sigue en mi interior

en nuestro punto de inflexión.

Y sigo esclavo de sus besos.



No hay quien controle al amor

de hecho te quiero como a nadie más

pero a veces es ella

la que me derrumba mi seguridad.



Yo soy así, y seguiré

vagando errante por tu piel

yo no podré

dar todo de mi

mientras que olvide a esa mujer.



Y sigo esclavo de sus besos

y sigo preso de mis miedos

hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión

Why don't you rise up now?

Don't be afraid to stand out

So when you get the chance (get the chance)

Are you gonna take it (take it)

There's a man who faith is dying

Love is calling you

Why take the easier road?

To serve you in all that we do
In joyous surrender

With our hearts full of praise

We sing of your mercy 

We sing of your love and your grace



Father hear our song

A song of praise to the worthy one



In joyous surrender

With our eyes fixed on you

May our lives bring you glory to serve you in all that we do



Father hear our song

A song of praise to the worthy one

Father we have come

To offer our lives to the holy one



And we live for your glory and we live by your love

And we sing of your glory and we sing of your love

And we live for your glory and we live by your love

And we sing of your glory and we sing of your love

A song of praise to the worthy one

While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet

What kind of joy is this?



It's joy unspeakable, all You've done for me

It's indescribable, just a taste of Your glory

It's unnatural, not to tell the story of all You've given me

My words are incomplete, it's joy unspeakable



I have found the pleasure I once craved

It's joy and peace within, within

What a wondrous blessing I am saved

From the awful gulf of sin



It's joy unspeakable, all You've done for me

It's indescribable, just a taste of Your glory

It's unnatural, not to tell the story of all You've given me

My words are incomplete



I have found the joy no tongue can tell

How its waves of glory roll

It is like an overflowing well

Springing up within my soul



It's unspeakable, all You've done for me

It's indescribable, just a taste of Your glory

It's unnatural, not to tell the story of all You've given me

My words are incomplete

It's joy unspeakable

Hung on my horns
With haste and reverie
Killing with charm
Only happy when you hurt

Only deadly in a swarm

Only healthy in the dirt

Only empty in your arms



I play, I'm sick and tame

Drawing the hordes

I wait, and show tha lame

The meaning of harm

The skulls beneath my feet

Like feathers in sand

I graze among the graves

A feeling of peace



Only bending when you break

Only feeding when you're cold

Only healing when you ache

Only feeling when you don't"

We all shall die 

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast 

Armageddon's here, like said in the past 



Fight fire with fire 

Ending is near 

Fight fire with fire 

Bursting with fear 



Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death 

The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Before you shake my tomb

Fell to pieces and I'm still falling 



Every time I'm falling down 

All alone I fall to pieces



I keep a journal of memories 

I'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe 

I fall to pieces, I'm falling 

Fell to pieces and I'm still falling 



Every time I'm falling down 

All alone I fall to pieces



All the years I've tried 

With more to go 

Will the memories die 

I'm waiting 

Will I find you 

Can I find you

All alone I fall to pieces"

That I'm drowning in a puddle of misery

That you're gone

Away from me

I'm always afraid

That you're lost in somebody

I'm always afraid

That you're gone

Away from me

I'm always afraid 

That you're lost



So here I am 

I wanna be by myself

And I think you're fucking someone else

No more have to find a way

To take the knife out of my back

And how could you leave me

Stranded in a closet full of puddles



I'm always afraid

That you're gone

Away from me

I'm always afraid

That you're lost in somebody

I'm always afraid

That you're gone

Away from me

I'm always afraid 

That you're lost



Maybe you could let me stay

Maybe just for one more day

You could help me stay the same

Maybe things won't ever change

Maybe we could taste the rain

You could push me out the way



Now I sit here by myself

Think about somebody else

How could you let them take you away from me

There's somebody else"

Afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone

And I try so hard to be

Everything that I should never take away from you again

Que ya estoy casi enloqueciendo

Pero que vuelva a mi

Que sin ella no puedo vivir



Anda ve a decirle que no hay un segundo

Que no me haga falta sus caricias

Que me hacen daño los minutos

Que deliro por su sonrisa



Anda ve a decirle que mas primaveras

No vere llegar si no regresa

Que si las miradas no me llegan

Se que pierdo la cabeza



Dile que no hay un instante donde no pienso en su piel

Que me muero de angustia porque yo no la puedo ver

Y pierdo mil intentos en buscarla

Y no me habla

Que aun que rompi su foto aun su imagen sigue ahi

Clavada en mi memoria y no se puede salir

Que esta en cada rincon de nuestra casa

Que su recuerdo casi me mata



Dile que aqui esta el hombre que la ama

Que siempre a sido el dueno de su vida

Con el beso amargo de aquel licor,
hubiera bastado, mi amor.
Sólo una mentira se viene conmigo a pasear.

Con el vestido azul que un día conociste

me marcho sin saber si me besaste antes de irte.

Te di mi corazón y tú lo regalaste,

te di todo el amor que pude darte y me robaste.

He rasgado mi vestido con una copa de vino,

hoy tu amor corta como el cristal.



En el cielo hay playas donde ves la vida pasar,

donde los recuerdos no hacen llorar:

vienen muy despacio y se van.

Sólo una caricia me hubiera ayudado a olvidar

que no eran mis labios los que ahora te hacen soñar.

[Verso 1]
Cierro los ojos sin mirar atrás
Las cosas buenas pesan más y más
Y tus errores tienen la virtud de hacerme mal
Hasta he intentado escapar de aquí
Pero me cuesta renunciar a ti
Parece ser que voy del norte al sur una vez más

[Coro]
Algo de ti está acabando conmigo
Algo de mí se está muriendo contigo
Cada minuto se convierte en un siglo
Y cada sitio es un espacio vacío
Algo sin ti es nada y pierde el sentido
Porque sin ti vivir no es más que un castigo
Es como un barco que navega perdido
Yo sólo quiero rescatar, rescatar lo perdido

[Verso 2]
A veces pienso que esto es el final
Que no hay motivos para continuar
Pero yo siento que te quiero aún incluso más
Y si me quieres para qué pensar
Mientras tú piensas, la vida se va

Love was just something you found to add to your collection,
It used to seem we were number one, but now it sounds so far away,
I had a dream we were running from some blazing arrows yesterday,
You said fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire

Through desire, desi- sire, desi-, through your desire



Now the city blocks out the sun that you know is rising,

You can show me the work that you've done, your fears have been disguising,

Is it just me or is everyone, hiding out between the LIES,

Where will we be when we come undone? Just a simple meeting of the minds



SING we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire

Through desire, desi- sire, desi-, through your desire

We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire

Your desire, desi- sire, desi-, through your desire



UNDERNEATH your stars

There's a million LIES burning brightly just like fireFLIES.



It's cold and heaven surround you every direction,

Cause there's someone behind every hand that you've made a connection

And now we're free to be number one, morning isn't far away,

I had a dream we were holding on, and tomorrow HAS BECOME come today, BECOME today



And we'll fight with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire

Through desire, desi- sire, desi-, through your desire

We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire

I remember back in school, when I first laid my eyes on you;
I saw your smile and knew right then and there...
You reached out and touched my hand, and two became just one person, and
No one could have stopped our love affair...



But lately we can't even see each other, no, without acting just like distant lovers...

We've even took to fighting, under covers;

What a shame - baby, who's to blame?



Young love, why you wanna grow old on me now?

Young love, why you wanna grow old on me now?

Don't say goodbye, my love, no, no, no, baby;

Just one more try, young love...



I remember promises, the way I'd feel when we'd caress;

I can't imagine where young love went wrong...

You said that you needed me, but where is the sincerity?

I, I guess that with our love, that too has flown...



'Cause lately we can't even touch each other, without acting just like distant lovers...

We've even took to fighting, under covers;

What a shame - baby, who's to blame?



Young love, why you wanna grow old on me now?

Young love, why you wanna grow old on me now?

Don't say goodbye, my love, no, no, no, baby;

Just one more try, young love...



Do you remember the young love? Do you remember the love we shared?

Do you remember the young love? Do you remember the love we shared?

(When love was new, baby,)

Do you remember the young love? Do you remember the love we shared?

(And we were too, sugar!)

Do you remember the young love? Do you remember the love we shared?

(When love was new, baby,) 

Do you remember the young love? Do you remember the love we shared?

(And we both were too, sugar!)

Do you remember the young love? Do you remember the love we shared?

(Listen to me!)



Don't you think we ought to give it one more try?

We've come too far to be saying...



Oh, I... (Young love...) 

Give it one more try, oh... (Young love...)

Don't you remember, baby? (Young love...)

Young love was much better... (Young love...) 

Ooh, my love!



(Young love...) Why you wanna grow old on me?

(Young love...) Why you wanna keep me in misery?

(Young love...) Why you wanna say goodbye? Why you want to make me cry, baby?

(Young love...) Young love, my love, your love... 



(Young love...) Why you wanna say goodbye? Why you want to make me cry, baby? 

(Young love...) I'm cryin', baby!

Dreams are dreams - Some dreams come true

I found a real dream baby when I found you

You're so strong

But tender too

You're my angel, oh angel

You're my angel, oh angel



Love like ours is heaven sent

Each day a day to remember

I feel so safe

I feel secure with you

You give me love and keep right on giving

You fill me up baby with the joy of living

When things get tough I can always turn to you

You're my angel, oh angel

You're my angel



Love the way we touch

I love the way it feels

Everytime you're near me

My poor heart just won't keep still

No doubt about it that this love I feel is real

Ask me to go with you, you know I will

Hold me near, hold me tight

Only you can make it real

Only you can make it alright

Just let me know that I am special to you

What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end

And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you

I gotta let it burn



It's gonna burn for me to say this

But it's comin from my heart

It's been a long time coming

But we done been fell apart

Really wanna work this out

But I don't think you're gonna change

I do but you don't

Think it's best we go our separate ways

Tell me why I should stay in this relationship

When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby

Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with

I think that you should let it burn



When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to

But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to

Even though this might bruise you

Let it burn

Let it burn

Gotta let it burn



Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you

Hate the thought of her being with someone else

But you know that it's over

We know that it's through

Let it burn

Gotta let it burn



Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to

Got somebody here but I want you

Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself

Callin' her your name

Ladies tell me do you understand?

Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?

It's the way I feel

I know I made a mistake

Now it's too late

I know she ain't comin back

What I gotta do now

To get my shorty back

Ooo ooo ooo ooooh

Man I don't know what I'm gonna do

Without my booo

You've been gone for too long

It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours

Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)



When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to

But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to

Even though this might bruise you

Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn)

Let it burn (gotta let it burn)

Gotta let it burn



Deep down you know its best for yourself but you

Hate the thought of her being with someone else

But you know that it's over

We know that it's through

Let it burn

Let it burn

Gotta let it burn



I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on

On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)

I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on

On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)



Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh

Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)

So many days, so many hours

I'm still burnin' till you return



When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to

But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to

Even though this might bruise you

I just don't get it anymore.
They don't even gang-bang with a purpose.
Cold-hearted killers that barely that barely got facial hair.
I'm tired of tryin' to get through.
These days you try to be a hero, and your wife'll end up wearin' black listenin' to a 21 gun salute.

I just don't understand these young men.

Maybe I should quit fightin' what I don't understand.

Hmmm... I can't keep up with this too much longer.

Now that I need you

The autumn wind feels

As if it were you

And swayed through the fields

Where I once held you



It seems you lost your way

You've let it all fall apart

Nothing's left here but you

All you do is remind me

Now that we've lost out way

The rest can all fall apart

All I see here is you

All it does is remind me



Whistle through your window

We act the same as you



Whistle through your window

We act the same as you"

They'll take your pride and crush it
The fall that comes is real, by pure degradation
Amputate - Humiliate
Who can take this punishment?
Create something new - A warrior where there once was nothing



Destroy the body and mind - Behold the spirit can survive

Destroy the body and mind - Today is a good day to die



(Broken mind) - Face down in the sand

(Spirit) Spirit - (Rise) Rise



Destruction comes only once in a lifetime

Cannot be great in your mind

This is the time to say your last prayer

If you desire peace, then prepare for war



Destroy the body and mind - Behold the spirit can survive

Destroy the body and mind - Today is a good day to die

Destroy the body and mind - Behold the spirit can survive

Destroy the body and mind - I am ready for mine

578,Elliott Smith,Let's Get Lost,angry,"There are signs
Dividing in
That I couldn't abide
I wouldn't miss it again
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost

I had true love

But made it die

Pushed out of the way

She said please stay

Burning every bridge that I cross

To find some beautiful place to get lost

To find some beautiful place to get lost

I don't know where I'll go now

And I don't really care who follows me there

But ill burn every bridge that I cross

To find some beautiful place to get lost

To find some beautiful place to get lost"

[Verse 1]
They took me lightly like a quiet boosting of a piece of candy
From your favorite neighborhood corner store
Surely shoulda saw the weight
A heavy burden to carry the bare soiled slate
They don't wanna have a thing to do with
Can't blame them take a look
Can't name 'em cause they shook
Took over some wit-protect
Stay with your kin boy
Fuck around with B'more
Make you look like you're white in a Harlem shaking contest
I harness the fondest crooks of phonics
Fuck grammar, ill-mannered
Don't start with Spank

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Awww ease up motherfucker, take a breath
You look beat, I'm more you're more the less
Oh ease up motherfucker, take a breath
You look beat now, now I suggest you take a rest
You might also like[Verse 2]
Can't say what I will or won't do
Stretch the height
You might want to stay on your toes to
Secure a full view
For skewed vision conditions lead you to assume
And while you assume
I'm feeling uneasy
My patterns are broken
Shared my thoughts but my guts don't even believe me
Sleep don't relieve me, it's like doom conceived me
Got a whole lot of something, yet I constantly feel
Like nothing much, just your average such and such
So much acclaimed moving
But nigga I'm really touched

What was I drinking?
(falling under would've boxed that nigga
If you didn't pull me back, spitting on his new shoes)

What was he thinking?
(man I wonder, do I smile too much?
Yes, you too can get fucked up)

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it...

I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it and in the end
All these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me what it...

And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is

(sit the fuck…there ain't no dancing, no dancing)

[Verse 3 x 2]
My tongue is the drum
My mind’s the machine
Non dreamer's far fantastic extremes
Fall victim to this think tank-M16
Sound, sharp, fixed, fit, creased, greased, and clean

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl

And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you

Were gonna fall in love

My love for you

I'll never let go

I've got so much love

Let me show how much I love you baby (show you)

I don't mind and I don't mind (loving you)

Girl I love you

There's no one above you

You are the sun

You are the rain

That makes my life this foolish game

You need to know

I love you so

And I'd do it all again and again



Tell me it's true

I can't believe you do what you do

I've got so much love

And my love you'll see

We'll stay together, just you and me

I've got so much love



Only you (know me)

Tell me how to love you baby (show me)

I don't mind and I don't mind (tell me)

Girl, I love you

And I need your love for always

Cause when I'm with you

I fall in love

Ya lo que pasó, pasó

Rescatémos lo que no unió 



Que todos aprendemos de nuestros errores

Qué difícil es vivir

You're the kind who is capturing my heart

All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
'Cause I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain

I haven't the need for the pain

Not since I've known you



You showed me how, how to leave myself behind

How to turn down the noise in my mind

Now I haven't got time for the pain

I haven't got room for the pain

I haven't the need for the pain

Not since I've known you



Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive

Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world

'Til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love

How to open up and drink in all that white love

Pouring down from the heaven

I haven't got time for the pain

I haven't got room for the pain

I haven't the need for the pain

Not since I've known you"

Reaching for the lonely one

When we put emotions on the line

Got to be there, got to be there 
Bring her good times 
And show her that she's my girl 

Oh what a feeling there'll be 

The moment I know she loves me 

'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 

I need her sharing her world beside me 



So I've got to be there 

Got to be there in the morning 

And welcome her into my world 

And show her that she is my girl 

When she says, ""Hello world!"" 

I need her sharing the world beside me 



That's why I've got to be there 

Got to be there where love begins 

And that's everywhere she goes 

I've got to be there so she knows 

That when she's with me, she's home 



Got to be there 

Got to be there"

And a wonderful love was born



We were all alone

On his hobnailed boots

Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy

Working overtime

A soap impression of his wife which he ate

And donated to the National Trust.

Down to the bits that I left uptown

I need a fix cause I'm going down



Mother Superior jump the gun

Mother Superior jump the gun

Mother Superior jump the gun

And I feel my finger on your trigger

How could she have another headache

There's always some kind of excuse

I still hate my job, my boss is a dick

""I don't get paid nearly enough

To put up with all of your shit""



I hate my job, all of my rich friends

I hate everyone to the bitter end.

Nothing turns out right There's no end in sight

I hate my life! 



I hate that I can't tell when a girl's underage, 

You know, I tell her she's a nice piece of ass, 

Then her daddy punches me in the face



So if you're pissed like me

Bitches, here's what you gotta do

Put your middle fingers up in the air

Go on and say ""Fuck you!""



I hate my job, all of my rich friends

I hate everyone to the bitter end.

Nothing turns out right There's no end in sight

I hate my life! 



So much at stake, can't catch a break

I hate my life

No, it's nothing new hear ""it sucks to be you""

I fuckin hate my life"

Can you feel my trigger-hand moving further down your back
When you hide, hide inside that body
But just remember that when I touch you
The more you shake, the more you give away

Cold but I'm still here, blind 'cause I'm so blind, say never
We're far from comfortable this time

A little dot on a state road map
That's where I was born & where I'll die
Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in a rat race
And these days that's a special way to fly



Down home where they know you by name and treat you like family

Down home a man's good word and a handshake are all you need

Folks know if they're fallin on hard times they can fall back on

Those of us raised up down home



In the corner of a hardware store

Gathered round a checker board

Old men telling lies & crowning kings

Kids drivin round the old town square

Tops rolled down in the cool nite air

Go & see what's shakin at the Dairy Queen



Down home where they know you by name and treat you like family

Down home a man's good word and a handshake are all you need

Folks know if they're fallin on hard times they can fall back on

Those of us raised up down home



When I was a boy I couldn't wait to leave this place

But now I wanna see my children raised



Down home

Down home

Folks know if they're fallin on hard times they can fall back on

Where they know you by name and treat you like family

Can't imagine what else could wrong

Tomorrow's another day

And I'm thirsty anyway

So bring on the rain



It's almost like the hard times circle ¡®round

A couple drops and they all start coming down

Yeah, I might feel defeated,

I might hang my head

I might be barely breathing - but I'm not dead

[Music by: Kirk Backarach]
This is for freedom
This is for those who care
I got my reason

No more in despair

We stand united

This is decided

The hand of fury

You're all invited



I crawl out of this nightmare

Out of the shadows

I walk into the devil's lair

My life

My path

Is where faith grows



Cause I'm still alive

Feed the ﬁre inside

I'm

I'm still alive

The fuel

The ﬂame

Will ignite



This is the threshold

This is the quickening

No more rampage

In the battle ring

Fight for independence

For what you believe

The right to stand out

The glory to receive



I crawl out of this nightmare

Out of the shadows

I walk into the devil's lair

My life

My path

Is where faith grows



Cause I'm still alive

Feed the ﬁre inside

I'm

I'm still alive

The fuel

The ﬂame

Will ignite



Take now what I've learned from

All these years of agony

And bring it

Take now

What I've learned from all these years of agony

And bring it to you



Bring it here tonight"
663,The Sword,Freya,sad,"11 ContributorsFreya LyricsA sword of fire and an axe of cold
Vision of the sibyl has foretold
Armies gather on the battle plain
All will fall and Earth will die in flame

Here on the battle plain
We will die in flame

In falcon's feathers soaring overhead
Choosing warriors among the dead
Twilight written in the runes of crones
Freya weeps upon her golden throne

Upon her golden throne
We wait for her alone
Call us unto your hall
Take us into your thrall
The battle rages, but they fight in vain
When all is done, it must begin againYou might also likeEmbed

I'm lying in my bed
Hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
And you said, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look

666,Tanya Tucker,Some Kind Of Trouble,angry,"Late one night, I heard a knock on my door,
No surprise, it was my landlord.
Notified me I was late with the rent.
What can you do when your last dollar's spent,
You got trouble.
Some kind of trouble.



I called up my baby for a little advice,

'Cos my sugar baby always treats me so nice.

I had a funny feelin' that he wasn't alone,

I heard another voice whisper: ""Hang up the 'phone.""

I got trouble.

Some kind of trouble.



Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind,

There's never any trouble for me to find,

Some kind of trouble.(Some kind of trouble.)



I went to my boss, said: ""I need a little time.

""To work on this poor broken heart of mine.""

He said: ""I'd like to help you, I been there before.

""The problem is, girl, you don't work here no more.

""You got trouble.""

""Some kind of trouble.""



Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind,

There's never any trouble for me to find,

Some kind of trouble. (Oooh, some kind of trouble.)



I got trouble.



I was down around as low as a body can be,

So I talked to my preacher about prayin' for me.

He smiled and he said: ""Child, you're not alone.

""'Cos all God's children got to deal with their own,

""Kinda Trouble.

""Some kind of trouble.""



Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind,

There's never any trouble for me to find,

Some kind of trouble. (Oooh, some kind of trouble.)



Some kind of trouble. (Oooh, some kind of trouble.)

Trouble in my heart.

Trouble on my mind. (Oooh, some kind of trouble.)

Trouble, any trouble,

For me to find. (Oooh, some kind of trouble.)"
667,Tanya Tucker,Down To My Last Teardrop,relaxed,"They said your love life's in trouble in a magazine I read
When the one you love is hangin' off of his side of the bed
Baby, you just ain't been hangin' on
Honey I know you'll soon be gone
And I don't need my palm read to know what lies ahead

I can see you in the arms of another girl instead

Baby this ain't the first time

Honey it's gonna be the last time



And I know that you'll be thinkin' I'll be goin' out of my mind

Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds

Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time



I don't care a hoot or what you're doin'

Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'

Baby this time I swear it's the truth

I ain't gonna cry no more for you

Uh-uh



Now I know where I'm goin' baby I know where I'm bound

I've been rearanging chairs on a ship that's goin' down

Baby, just step aside if you will

Honey, it's really over for good



And you might want to talk to me, you might want to call

But you won't hear nothin' out of me at all

Cause Baby, I ain't got nothin' left to say

Honey, I'll just be on my way



And I know that you'll be thinkin' I'll be goin' out of my mind

Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds

Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time



I don't care a hoot or what you're doin'

Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'

Baby this time I swear it's the truth

I ain't gonna cry no more for you



And I know that you'll be thinkin' I'll be goin' out of my mind

Baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time"
668,Shadows Fall,Still I Rise,angry,"Stop searching the sky for answers
And look within
Our greatest gift
Is the life we are given
This is the price you pay

For throwing your whole life away



How can you know yourself

When your world is just a lie



Still I rise!

From the ashes

Look Inside

Search for meaning

Truth cannot survive



I feel the hate inside you

I watch it burn

You heard the warnings

But you, you never learned



This is the price you pay

For throwing your whole life away



How can you know yourself

When your world is just a lie



Still I rise!

From the ashes

Look inside

Search for meaning

Truth will not survive



Watch it burn

The hate inside you

No return

Ignore the warning signs"

As we're both lying here
There's so many things I want to say
I will always love you
I would never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget

Say things I might regret

It breaks my heart to see you crying

I don't wanna lose you

I could never make it alone



I am a man who will fight for your honor

I'll be the hero you're dreaming of

We'll live forever

Knowing together that we

Did it all for the glory of love



You'll keep me standing tall

You'll help me through it all

I'm always strong when you're beside me

I have always needed you

I could never make it alone



I am a man who will fight for your honor

I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of

We'll live forever

Knowing together that we

Did it all for the glory of love



Just like a knight in shining armor

From a long time ago

Just in time I will save the day

Take you to my castle far away



I am a man who will fight for your honor

I'll be the hero you're dreaming of

We're gonna live forever

Knowing together that we

Did it all for the glory of love



We'll live forever (we'll live forever)

Knowing together that we (knowing together)

Did it all for the glory of love

671,Blessid Union Of Souls,I Believe,happy,"Walk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand 
Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand 
Open up your mind and then open up your heart 
And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart 
'Cause I believe that love is the answer 

I believe that love will find the way 



Violence is spread worldwide and there are families on the street 

And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see 

That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today 

Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay 



But I believe that love is the answer 

I believe that love will find the way 

I believe that love is the answer 

I believe that love will find the way 



I've been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year 

She said she's never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear 

That one day daddy's gonna find out she's in love 

With a nigger from the streets 

Oh how he would lose it then but she's still here with me 

'Cause she believes that love will see it through 

And one day he'll understand 

And he'll see me as a person not just a black man 



'Cause I believe that love is the answer 

I believe that love will find the way 

I believe I believe I believe I believe that love is the answer 

I believe that love will find the way 

Love will find the way 

Love will find the way 

Love will find the way 

Please love find the way 

Please love find the way"

And holding fast the truth
I don't want to lose what I had as a boy
My heart still as a beat
But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in L.A.

Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder

Is it a spell that I am under

Keeping me from seeing the real thing



Love hurts

But sometimes it's a good hurt

And it feels like I'm alive

Love sings

When it transcends the bad things

Have a heart and try me

Cause without love I'won't survive



I'm fettered and abused

I stand naked and accused

Should I surface this one man submarine

I only want the truth

So tonight we drink to youth

I'll never lose what I had as a boy

Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder

Is it a spell that I am under

Keeping me from seeing the real thing



Love hurts

And it feels like I'm alive

When he smiles on my face 

His clouds all seem so out of place 



When he smiles on my face 

His clouds all seem so out of place 



I will love you til the sky above you 

Shatters over you and me 

And lays us down to sleep forever

Cracked up the walkway to my door 

Brought you as a sunbeam on my floor 

Beamed you down on me from the other side 

Brought you up to me across an ocean wide 



The sky sometimes so unkind 

Then again he's my best friend 

When he smiles on my face 

His clouds all seem so out of place

Shatters over you and me

709,Chalino Sanchez,El Crimen De Culiacan,sad,"4 ContributorsEl Crimen De Culiacán Lyrics[Letra de ""El Crimen De Culiacán""]

[Verso]
Les cantaré este corrido a dos hombres que mataron
Sin tenerles compasión vilmente los torturaron
Y ya muertos, con un carro por encima les pasaron
En la colonia El Palmito, la ciudad fue Culiacán
Andaban Francisco López, también Francisco Beltrán
Ellos no se imaginaban que los iban a matar
Francisco López tenía unas cuentas atrasadas
Había matado derecho al que le robó a su amada
Pero Francisco Beltrán no tenía culpa de nada
Otro día los encontraron al amanecer el día
Tenían las tripas de fuera y un perro se las comía
Unos momentos después, llegaba la policía
Con la banda sinaloense los fueron a sepultar
Y dos madresitas lloran sin poderse consolar
Por sus hijos adorados que ahorita en el cielo están
Ya con esta me despido, y les digo en mi cantar
Que las malas compañías nada bueno han de dejar
Lo digo por el corrido, no se les vaya a olvidarYou might also likeEmbed

710,Shedaisy,Come Home Soon,relaxed,"(Kristyn Osborn, John Shanks)
I put away the groceries
And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed



I don't know what you're doin' 

And I don't know where you are

But I look up at that great big sky

And I hope you're wishin' on that same 

bright star



I wonder, I pray



Chorus:

And I sleep alone

I cry alone

And it's so hard livin' here on my own

So please, come home soon

(Come home soon)



I know that we're together

Even though we're far apart

And I'll wear our lucky penny 'round my neck 

Pressed to my heart



I wonder, I pray



(Repeat Chorus)



Bridge:

I still imagine your touch

It's beautiful missing something that much

But sometimes love needs a fighting chance

So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance



I wonder, I pray



Second Chorus:

I sleep alone

I cry alone

Without you this house is not a home

So please, come home soon



Third Chorus:

I walk alone

I try alone

I'll wait for you, don't want to die alone

So please, come home soon



Come home soon

Come home soon"
711,Garth Brooks,Standing Outside The Fire,angry,"We call them cool 
Those hearts that have no scars to show 
The ones that never do let go 
And risk the tables being turned 
We call them fools 

Who have to dance within the flame 

Who chance the sorrow and the shame 

That always comes with getting burned 



But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire 

'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire 



We call them strong 

Those who can face this world alone 

Who seem to get by on their own 

Those who will never take the fall 



We call them weak 

Who are unable to resist 

The slightest chance love might exist 

And for that forsake it all 



They're so hell-bent on giving ,walking a wire 

Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire 



Standing outside the fire 

Standing outside the fire 

Life is not tried, it is merely survived 

If you're standing outside the fire 



There's this love that is burning 

Deep in my soul 

Constantly yearning to get out of control 

Wanting to fly higher and higher 

I can't abide 

Standing outside the fire 



Standing outside the fire 

Standing outside the fire 

Life is not tried, it is merely survived 

If you're standing outside the fire 



Standing outside the fire 

Standing outside the fire 

Life is not tried, it is merely survived 

If you're standing outside the fire"
712,Lee Ann Womack,I May Hate Myself In The Morning,angry,"Ain't it just like one of us to pick up the phone and call after a couple of drinks,
And say: ""How you been? I been wonderin' that maybe you've been thinkin' 'bout me.""
And somewhere in the conversation, an old familiar invitation always arrives,
An' I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight.
Everyone's known someone that they just can't help but want;

And even though we just can't make it work out, well the want-to lingers on.

So once again we wind up in each other's arms, pretending that it's right,

An' I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight.



I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy moving on.

So why can't two friends remember the good times once again?



Tomorrow when I wake up, I'll be feeling a little guilty, an' a little sad,

Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad.

An' I guess that's what it is, in lonely late night calls like this, that we try to find;

An' I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight.



I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight."

715,DeBarge,All This Love,happy,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.


You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.

It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance 

And learned the ways of love, my baby. 

There is so much love inside me, 

And all that I have I'll give my all to you; 

All, all my love, baby and: 



All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar; 

And all this love is waiting for you.

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar; 

And all this love is waiting for you.



As the sun has its place up in the sky, 

I love you so dearly, 

And all the same there's no need to wonder why.

I need you, please hear me.

Say you really love me baby,

Say you really love me, darlin';

'Cause I really love you, baby.

Oh, I really love you, darlin.



Say you really love me baby,

Say you really love me, darlin';

'Cause I really love you, baby."

718,Elvis Costello,One Bell Ringing,sad,"Raining slapping on the window pane
An hour or more of teeming
Storm punching like a hurricane
That tore him out of dreaming
Air screaming through the slightest gap

Rattling between the frame and the sill

Drapes hanging from the final act

When I had you still



One lonely bird is singing

Lower the hood hung of his lament

Dash him down on cold cement

One Bell Ringing



Flies buzzing round strip search light

They've got him down on his knees

He thinks of honey dripping from a spoon

Girls whispering in Portuguese



Between muzzle and the black site

Electrical contact

Deny your name and then carry the blame

Somewhat after the fact



One lonely bird is singing

Lower the hood hung on that last lament

Dash him down on cold cement

One Bell Ringing"

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me

Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up



Giving up, giving up

Giving up, giving up

Giving up



It's not your fault

I'm a bitch I'm a monster

Yes I'm a beast and I feast when I conquer

But I'm alone on my throne, all these witches

I came this way all this way just to say



This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me

Yes I'm giving up baby

And I can't seem to silent these voices in my head

Come save me

This time won't you save me?

Come save me

720,Brandon Heath,Your Love,happy,"I felt it first when i was younger 
a strange connection to the light
I try to satisfy the hunger 
i never got it right, 
I never got it

So I climbed a mountain and built an altar

Looked out as far as I can see

And everyday I'm getting older 

im running out of dreams, 

I'm running out of dreams



But your love, 

your love 

the only thing that matters is your love 

your love

Is all I have to give 

your love is enough to light up the darkness

Its your love 

all ever needed is your love



You know the effort i have given

And you know exactly what it cost

And though my innocence was taken 

not everything is lost,

not everything is lost, no



But Your love, 

your love 

the only thing that matters is your love, 

your love is all I have to give 

your love is enough to light up the darkness 

its your love 

your love 

all i ever needed its your love



You're the hope in the morning 

You're the light when the night is falling 

You're the song when my heart is singing 

Its your love

You're the eyes to the blind man

You're the feet for the lame man walking

You're the sound of the people singing 

its your love ( your love, your love )



But your love, 

your love

the only thing that matters is your love, 

your love is all i have to give 

your love is enough to light up the darkness 

It's your love, 

your love 

all i ever needed is your love



All I ever needed is your love, your love

All I never needed is your love

Its all I ever needed"

Es cuando yo digo
Que valió la pena
Todo,todo lo que yo he sufrido.
No se si es un sueño aún

O es una realidad

Pero cuando estoy contigo es cuando digo:



Que este amor que siento

Es porque tu lo has merecido,

Con decirte amor que otra vez he amanecido

Llorando de felicidad;

A tu lado yo siento que estoy viviendo

Nada es como ayer.



Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y el nunca perdona,

Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona.



Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo,

Abrázame que el tiempo es oro si tu estas conmigo,

Abrázame fuerte, muy fuerte, más fuerte que nunca,

Siempre abrázame.



Hoy que tu estas conmigo,

Yo no se si esta pasando el tiempo o tu lo has detenido

Así quiero estar por siempre,

Aprovecho que estas tu conmigo

Te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir

Tu cuando mires para el cielo,

Por cada estrella que aparezca amor es un ""te quiero"".



Abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo

Que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo:



Abrázame muy fuerte amor, mantenme así a tu lado

Yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado,

Quiero corresponderte de una forma u otra a diario;

Amor yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario,

Pero a mi me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí

En alguien que juró que daba su vida por mi.



Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y ese no se detiene,

Abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene,

Abrázame que dios perdona pero el tiempo a ninguno,

Abrázame que no le importa saber quien es uno,

Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y el nunca perdona

Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona,

Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo

Abrázame muy fuerte amor."

Porque no les tienes miedo

Esperando a sota de oros

Se aparece un caballero

Dispense mi buen amigo

Esque yo llegué primero



El que no lo quiera creer

Que le entre a lo pantera

Pierde dinero y mujer

Y hasta la portamonedas

Y a veces llega a su casa

Con la camisa de fuera



Y ni modo de reclamos

Porque yo llegé a caballo

Estoy regando el rosal

Pa cortar la flor de mayo

Perdoneme rey de copas

Pero yo soy de a caballo

I've been facing all the days without you

So tell me you care



Oh I believe in love

I believe in you

Things you do

I'm falling in love again with you

Tried to let it go but it wouldn't die

I know why Love is forever

Love is forever with you"

There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart



Young love (young love), first love (first love)

Filled with true devotion

Young love (young love), our love (our love)

We share with deep emotion



Just one kiss from your sweet lips

Will tell me that your love is real

And I can feel that it's true

We will vow to one another

There will never be another

Love for you or for me

733,Dolly Parton,Yellow Roses,relaxed,"Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic

And I found you sweet and bold

Though we'd only met

I still said yes

To a single yellow rose



And for years to come

You were the one

To sleep with me at night

To laugh and talk

And share my thoughts

And hold me when I'd cry

And on every occasion

And for no good reason to

A big bouquet or a single yellow rose

Was sent from you



Yellow roses

The color of sunshine

You loved me at one time

Why did you have to go

Yellow roses

Are you sending your new love

My bright yellow rose buds

I still love you so



I never see a yellow rose

That I didn't think of you

It's still my favorite flower

Though the yellow's turned to blue

The day you left my teardrops fell

Upon your farewell not

You said goodbye like you said hello

With a single yellow rose



Yellow roses

The color of sunshine

You loved me at one time

Why did you have to go

Yellow roses

Are you sending your new love

My bright yellow rose buds

Oh I still love you so



Yellow roses

The color of sunshine

You loved me at one time

Why did you have to go

Sweet yellow roses

Are you sending your new love

My bright yellow rose buds

I still love you so"

First take this drink and this pill

Relax your mind and be still

Don't care for anyone else

I get my facts from the TV

Believe in everything I read

It's such an ignorant bliss

When the whole fucking world wants to be like me

Wake up the dream is over

Hahahahaha they failed as they were thrown to the ground

No one can destroy the metal

The metal will strike you down with a vicious blow

We are the vanquished foes of the metal

We tried to win for why we do not know

But the metal had its way

Grunge then tried to dethrone the metal

But the metal was in the way

But metal was much too strong

Techno tried to defile the metal

But techno was proven wrong

Yeah!

Concedida, sin pedirlo

Mucho tiempo antes de nacer



No hay camino que

Llegue hasta aquí

Y luego pretenda salir

Con el fuego de

El atardecer arde la hierba



En algún lugar de un gran país

Olvidaron construir

Un hogar donde no queme el sol

Y al nacer no haya que morir

Un silbido cruza el pueblo

Y se ve, un jinete

Que se marcha con el viento

Mientras grita

Que no va a volver



Y la tierra aquí

Es de otro color

El polvo no te deja ver

Los hombres ya no

Saben si lo son

Pero lo quieren creer

Las madres que ya

No saben llorar

Ven a sus hijos partir

La tristeza aquí

No tiene lugar

Cuando lo triste es vivir

Se murio su huapanguero
Ya no se oye aquel falsete
Que es el alma del trovero

Y era sones de la sierra
Las canciones del trovero

La Azucena y la Cecilia
Lloran, lloran sin consuelo
Malaguena salerosa
Ya se fue su pregonero

Hoy comienza la molienda

Y suspira en cada vuelta

Por los verdes cafetales

745,Audioslave,Original Fire,angry,"The original fire has died and gone, but the riot inside moves on (x4)
With a pen in one hand, taking us and burned on kerosine
Headed for a fire would find us something to believe
Wallowing round with dirty hands on wires
Singing songs in dischord choirs

Screaming in brail, no temptress prize

could ever yield anything so real



The original fire has died and gone, but the riot inside moves on (x2)



Golden soldiers born much older than they'll ever live to be

Diving into a sea of hands in a long forgotten city

When the rain falls ever after

the swinging vines hang dead in rafters

Blood rush to (here?) your head induces of laughter endlessly



The original fire has died and gone, but the riot inside moves on

The original fire has died and long gone, but the riot inside moves on



Can't explain it, it was something to see

Can't contain something so ever real

Ever real



Can't explain it, it was something to see

Can't contain something so ever real

Ever real

There is no sickness, toil, nor danger
In that fair land to which I go

I'm going home

No more to roam

I am just going over Jordan

I am just going over home



I know dark clouds will hover o'er me,

I know my pathway is rough and steep

But golden fields lie out before me

Where weary eyes no more will weep

I'm going home to see my father

I'm going home no more to roam

I am just going over Jordan

I am just going over home



I'll soon be free from every trial

This form shall rest beneath the sun

I'll drop the cross of self-denial

And enter in that home with God

Waitin for me to finally call.

She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own, I never had a home
And an eighteen-year-old boy has got to eat

She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose

This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

She was a handsome woman just thirty-five
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do

And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of, I suppose
But she died knowing that I really loved her

Streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up
From another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road
Once again it seems

All that's left behind

Is a chain of broken dreams

But you know that I love you

You know that I love you

Oh, I love you



And how I wish that love

Was all we'd need to live

What a life we'd have

'Cause I've got so much to give

But ya' know I feel so sad

Down inside my heart

That the dollar sign

Should be keepin' us apart

But you know that I love you

You know that I love you

Oh, how I love you



And if only I could find my way back to the time

When the problems of this life

Had not yet crossed my mind

And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes

I'd come runnin' back to you

I'd come runnin' back to you

Mmmmm



But you know we can't

Live on dreams alone

Got to pay the rent

So I must leave you all alone

'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago

And now this travelin' life

Well, it's the only life I know

But you know that I love you

You know that I love you

Oh, I love you

But you know that I love you

You know that I love you

Oh, how I love you

761,Elvis Presley,Jailhouse Rock,sad,"The warden threw a party in the county jail.
The prison band was there and they began to wail.
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block

was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.



Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone,

Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.

The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,

the whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

Everybody in the whole cell block

was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.



Number forty-seven said to number three:

""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.

I sure would be delighted with your company,

come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me.""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

Everybody in the whole cell block

was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.



The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone

way over in the corner weepin' all alone.

The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square.

If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair.""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

Everybody in the whole cell block

was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.



Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake,

no one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break.""

Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, ""Nix nix,

I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks.""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

Everybody in the whole cell block

was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock."

That softly reminds me
Tonight I'll park out on the hill
And wait until they find me
You're slipping through the ether

A voice is coming through

So keep me in your heart tonight

And I'll save my love for you



So turn up your radio and darling dial me in close

We're riding on the airwaves

And we're traveling coast to coast

Over river and highway

Your voice comes clear and true

Though we're far apart tonight

I'll save my love for you



Hold me in your arms and our doubts won't break us

If we open up our hearts love won't forsake us

Just let the music take us

And carry us home



There's a prayer coming through the air

And it's shot straight through my heart

Tearing open the evening sky and tearing me apart

Now I'll ride that signal down the line

I'm home again with you

So turn up your radio

And I'll save my love for you

Turn up your radio and I'll save my love for you"

I know I'm not the only one standing here 
And in the darkness I was walking through the night 
I could see your guiding light, very clear 
This is your life

This is your moment

This is your life

This is your moment



When I was weak we both went walking on the sand 

We were walking hand in hand, it appeared 

Once set our footprints when you carried me along 

It was then that I abandoned my fears 



This is your life

This is your moment

This is your life

How many in your butterfly net

Build me a star in your forehead

But I think I get you now

I think I get you now



This is me starring

In a stranger's nightmare

Don't let the bathwater get too high

You will be a flood of porcelain

It's digging hard into your tiles



And we're going to flood this house

We're going to flood this house

To drag you down with me 

To kick the last nail in

Like I like you to scream 

But if you open your mouth 

Then I can't be responsible 

For quite what goes in 

Or to care what comes out 

So just pull on your hair 

Just pull on your pout 

And let's move to the beat 

Like we know that it's over 

If you slip going under 

Slip over my shoulder 

So just pull on your face 

Just pull on your feet 

And let's hit opening time

Pull on your face

Bored To Death 

I'm Just Bored To Tears 

Same Old Shit Just Different Day & Year 

Killed Myself But That Got Boring Too 

So Beyond The Point Where It's Not True 



The Colors I See Are All Bleeding 

The Sound That Was Is Now Standing Still 

I Wonder When It Was It All Faded 

A Dullen Corpse That Cannot Be Killed 



Oh 

Bored To Death 

I'm Just Bored To Tears 

Same Old Shit Just Different Day & Year 

Killed Myself But That Got Boring Too 

So Beyond The Point Where It's Not True 



The Rose Petalled Garden 

Yeah.......



Alone In The Garden 

And All That Would Be 

Alone In The Garden 

You thought would set you free 

Nowhere to draw water 

And If You Could It Would Be Damned 

Go On Turn Your Back Now 

On Everything... 



Yeah......."
783,George Michael,I Want Your Sex,happy,"There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show

Sometimes you think you're gonna get it

But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you

Won't tell you no lies

I don't need no Bible

Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby

Now that we're friends

Every man's got his patience

And here's where mine ends



I want your sex

I want your love

I want your sex

I want your sex



It's playing on my mind

It's dancing on my soul

It's taken so much time

So why don't you just let me go

I'd really like to try

Oh I'd really love to know

When you tell me you're gonna regret it

Then I tell you that I love you but you still say no

I swear I won't tease you

Won't tell you no lies

I don't need no Bible

Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby

Out in the cold

I can't take much more girl

I'm losing control



I want your sex

I want your love

I want your sex

I want your sex



It's natural

It's chemical, let's do it

It's logical

Habitual, can we do it

It's sensual

But most of all

Sex is something we should do

Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural - sex is good

Not everybody does it

But everybody should

Sex is natural - sex is fun

Sex is best when it's one on one, one on one

I'm not your father, I'm not your brother

Talk to your sister, I'm a lover, c-c-c-c-come on



What's your definition of dirty baby

What do you consider pornography

Don't you know I love you till it hurts me baby

Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

What you're definition of dirty baby

What do you call pornography

Don't you know I love you till it hurts me baby

Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

Sex with me

Sex with me

Have sex with me, c-c-c-c-come on"

Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night

In blood laced misery

Scorched earth the policy

The reason for the siege

The pendulum it shaves the blade

The strafing air blood raid



Infiltration push reserves

Encircle the front lines

Supreme art of strategy

Playing on the minds

Bombard till submission

Take all to their graves

Indication of triumph

The number(s) that are dead



[Chorus:]

Sport the war, war support

The sport is war, total war

When victory's a massacre [sings ""really massacre"" 1st time,]

[""really survival"" 2nd]

The final swing is not a drill

It's how many people I can kill



[Solo: Hanneman]



[Chorus]



Be dead fiend from above

When darkness falls

Descend onto my sights

Your fallen walls

Spearhead break through the lines

Flanked all around

Soldiers of attrition

Forward their ground

Regime prophetic age

Old in its time

Flowing veins run on through

Deep in the Rhine

Center of the web

All battles scored

What is our war crimes

(era forever more... war)

Propaganda war ensemble

Burial to be

Bones shining by the night

In blood laced misery

Campaign of elimination

Twisted psychology

When victory is to survive

And death is defeat



Sport the war, war support

The sport is (war,) total war

When victory's a massacre (doesn't sing this)

When victory is survival (or this!)

When this end is a slaughter

The final swing is not a drill

It's how many people I can kill"

Sólo vivo extrañándote, y en
Mis horas añorándote, la noche

Compañía, y me hace solo recordar
Lo triste de mi vivir

Empiezo a sentir ganas de llorar, de decirte
Siempre te he de amar, que sin tí mas ya
No puedo estar Decirte, que el silencio es cruel
Cuando no hay una sonrisa Es cierto no hay
Amor infiel, cuando se ama de verdad

Cómo me haces falta, cómo me haces
Falta, la noche es quieta y se oye mi voz, te
Está llamando mi alma, cómo me
Haces falta, cómo me haces falta No
Aguanto más creo que partiré la
Soledad me espanta No puedo ver que mi vida se

Sobre el filo de cuchillo aquel
Era tanta la necesidad y el vació de mi alma
Que al tratarte un poquito yo me enamore
Ya me lo avían dicho que eras cruel
Rosa con el alma de papel

Me alertaron mil beses que tu ibas a lastimarme

Pero ya te adoraba y Ti me aferre

Guarde mi tonto arguyo a piedra y lodo

Y ame con toda el alma y te di todo

Y tú a cambio me dabas a besos veneno mortal

Pero ya estabas tan adentro

Ya te adoraba más que nadie

Maldito amor accidental

Quizás podrás pensar que estoy deseando

Tu muerte por todo el daño que me has hecho

Pero no no podría causarte el más leve dolor

Voy a quererte para siempre

Voy a llevarte aquí en mi mente

Por que a tu ser me acostumbre

Tú vivirás eternamente

Como el amor que nunca fue

This time it's goodbye, dear

Loving you the way I do, I take you back

Without you I'd die, dear

i don't know where us or this start

all of this is tearing us apart

i don't know where us or this start



if there's anyone near when we collide

we throw them in the middle

they can pick sides

as the plans turn into compromise

the promises all turn to lies

the spite builds up and i can't get through

passive me agressive you

i know i nag, i moan i know

but with a plan like this it's way too slow

in the time it took to get this bad

i could have made this work but all i had was

the hope that pieces would take shape

and we could watch them all fall into place



fall into place

fall into place

fall into place

You hold on, the water was slippery

You listen, the weather was answering

You've got your reasons that, hey hey,

Turned by the seasons and long days gone

Too many minds in my, I don't know,

Got in the way of my busting out



Cold and under, I almost forgot to

Face up to what i ought to.

Willing and I do give offering to you

Willing and I do give offering to you

Don't know why I feel so different

Feel just like a different person

Willing and I do give offering to you



You're tied in a knot, can't throw you back here.

You've got the floor, they say. You gotta lock it up.

Late into the night you wore off that fever.

That fever.



You've got your reasons that, hey hey,

Turned by the seasons and long days gone.

Too many minds in my, I don't know

Got in the way of my busting out.

Tight as a knot, i want to fade.

809,Kaiser Chiefs,I Predict A Riot,angry,"Watching the people get lairy 
Is not very pretty I tell thee 
Walking through town is quite scary 
And not very sensible either 
A friend of a friend he got beaten 
He looked the wrong way at a policeman 

Would never have happened to Smeaton 

And old Leodiensian 

La-ah-ah, la la lalala la 

Ah-ah-ah, la la lalala la 



I predict a riot, I predict a riot 

I predict a riot, I predict a riot 



I tried to get in my taxi 

A man in a tracksuit attacked me 

He said that he saw it before me 

Wants to get things a bit gory 

Girls run around with no clothes on 

To borrow a pound for a condom 

If it wasn't for chip fat, well they'd be frozen 

They're not very sensible 



La-ah-ah, la la lalala la 

Ah-ah-ah, la la lalala la 



I predict a riot, I predict a riot 

I predict a riot, I predict a riot 



And if there's anybody left in here 

That doesn't want to be out there 



Watching the people get lairy 

Is not very pretty I tell thee 

Walking through town is quite scary 

And not very sensible 



La-ah-ah, la la lalala la

824,Peter Gabriel,Digging In The Dirt,sad,"Something in me, dark and sticky
All the time it's getting strong
No way of dealing with this feeling
Can't go on like this too long
{Chorus:}

This time you've gone too far [x3]

I told you [x4]

This time you've gone too far [x3]

I told you [x4]



Don't talk back

Just drive the car

Shut your mouth

I know what you are

Don't say nothing

Keep your hands on the wheel

Don't turn around

This is for real

Digging in the dirt

Stay with me, I need support

I'm digging in the dirt

To find the places I got hurt

Open up the places I got hurt



The more I look, the more I find

As I close on in, I get so blind

I feel it in my head, I feel it in my toes

I feel it in my sex, that's the place it goes



[Chorus]



I'm digging in the dirt

Stay with me I need support

I'm digging in the dirt

To find the places I got hurt

To open up the places I got hurt



Digging in the dirt

To find the places we got hurt

A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
Till the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun

Out of my dreams and into my life

You are the one, you are the one



CHORUS:

Said I loved you but I lied

'Cause this is more than love I feel inside

Said I loved you but I was wrong

'Cause love could never ever feel so strong

Said I loved you but I lied



With all my soul I've tried in vain

How can mere words my heart explain

This taste of heaven so deep so true

I've found in you

So many reasons in so many ways

My life has just begun

Need you forever, I need you to stay

You are the one, you are the one



CHORUS:



You came to me like the dawn through the night

Just shinin' like the sun

Out of my dreams and into my life

You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you

But this is more than love I feel inside

Said I loved you....But I lied"

Or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us

Can't nobody take it apart

Or the heat from fire

Than for anyone to take my love from you, baby

'Cause you're my heart's desire



I really love you

(I love you)

I love you from the bottom of my heart



And what love has joined together

What love has joined together

What love has joined together

Can't nobody take it apart



Even if they separate us

A thousand miles apart

We will still be together

In each other's hearts



It would be easier to change

All the seasons of the year

Than for anyone to change

The way I feel about you, oh, I love you dear



I really love you

And with the slightest touch

We could set the night to music

We could set the night to music

We could do what we want to do

It'll only take me and you

To set the night to music



We'll find a rhythm all our own

Melt into it nice and slow

Love ourselves away from here

Your heart beating next to mine

Perfect love in perfect time

Watch the world, just disappear



This moment is our to take

And with the love we make

We could set the night to music

We could set the night to music

We could do what we want to do

It'll only take me and you

And with the love we make

And with the slightest touch

Happier now than I've been in the past
Gone are the days
Gone are the tears

The girl that you see standing in front of you

Keeps going on

Because she believes

In setting you freeeeeeee



So let me know when you're lonely babe

Let me know when you're lonely baby

Let me know when you're lonely babe

Let me know when you're lonely baby



I turn the other way

I could never turn you down

You turn me on

Don't speak out every meaning

I don't belong to you

Like you don't belong to me

So don't hold on too tightly

There forever be



So let me know when you're lonely babe

Let me know when you're lonely baby

Let me know when you're lonely babe



Always say in this cynical thing

Hold me

No ball and chain

I risk my reputation

Just to get more

You always have the reservation

Come lay down beside

Beside me

Beside me



So let me know when you're lonely babe

Let me know when you're lonely baby

Let me know when you're lonely babe

843,Mary J. Blige,Real Love ,happy,"We are lovers through and through and though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realise I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration? Be the real love that I need
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



When I met you I just knew that you would take my heart and run

Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one

So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of

And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true

I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind

But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong maybe I'll find a

Real love



So I've tried my best and prayed to God He'll send me someone real

To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel

Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all

Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



See I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go

Been around the world and high and low and still I never know

How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around

Gotta end it in this way cause it seems he can't be found



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love



Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free

Real love, I'm searching for a real love

I'm out to have a real love"

ya no sueñas viajes al caribe 

por tu rol de detective y mi papel del fugitivo, yo busco un sueño y tu un testigo. 



Siempre con la misma cantaneta 

me voy para no volver tengo listo el equipaje, llenas y vacias la maleta, 

como puedes pretender que me coma ese chantaje, tienes cero en actuacion, 

diez en manipulacion 

y una beca en el psiquiatra.

Con la dosis justa de sinismo 

preguntas que harias sin mi, 

si ya no vuelves a verne, 

para ser sincero haria lo mismo. 

solo que si estoy sin ti 

lo haria sin esconderme, 

lo haria sin esconderme...

Ever since the moment that I met you
You've been on my mind

So when you think about love, think about me

I can give you more than you'll ever need

Sooner or later every heart needs some company

When you think about love, think about me

When you think about love, think about me



We were strangers

Now I'm already wrapped around your finger

Oh whats a heart to do

'Cause it lingers

And the thought of you

Wantin' me as much as I want you



So when you think about love, think about me

I can give you more than you'll ever need

Sooner or later every heart needs some company

When you think about love, think about me

When you think about love, think about me



Makes me blue

I'm not holding you tonight

Cause only you can satisfy

This heart of mine



So when you think about love, think about me

Sooner or later every heart needs some company

When you think about love, think about me

853,Marty Robbins,Big Iron,sad,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
for the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town

He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around

He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip

And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip

big iron on his hip



In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red

Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead

He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four

And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more

One and nineteen more



Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around

Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town

He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead

And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red

After Texas Red



Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red

But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead

Twenty men had tried to take him twenty men had made a slip

Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip

Big iron on his hip



The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet

It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street

Folks were watching from the windows every-body held their breath

They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death

About to meet his death



There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play

And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today

Texas Red had not cleared leather fore a bullet fairly ripped

And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip

Big iron on his hip



It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round

There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground

Oh he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip

When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip

Big iron on his hip"

I'll keep you com-pa-ny.

Well, look here, is that a teardrop

In the corner of your pane

Now, don't you try

To tell me that it's rain.



She went a-way and left us all alone

The way she planned

Guess we'll have to learn to get along

With-out her if we can;



Hello, ceiling - (hello) (hello)

No bodder tell we turn the music down hold the pressure



Stress it jusa drive them underground

Cannot take the music killa sound

We will turn it up but never down

Stress it jusa drive them underground

Cannot take the music killa sound

We will turn it up but never down

866,My Morning Jacket,Circuital,sad,"Spinning out, gracefully
Going nowhere, quickly
I am older, day by day
Still going back to my childhood way
Circuital

Round and round patiently

Getting lost by the guide

And I'm all worked up over nothing



Circuits

All in and out

Connect my body

Deep into the ground



Circuits

Connect the Earth to the moon

And link our heavenly bodies

Not a moment too soon



Well you can fling open the windows

Or you can board them up

Saints to a crown

Or Christ's humble cup



You think you'll find yourself out there

Out in the lion's den

In somebody's battle

Over belief systems



Or disappear into the vacuum

Total neutrality

Well you can't lose nothing

But nothing can be gained



Well anyway you cut it

We're just spinning around

Out on the circuits

Over the hollow grounds

Out on the circuits

Over the hollow grounds

Heading right back in the same place

That we started out

Right back in the same place

Right back in the same place

That we starting out"
867,The Beatles,Yer Blues,sad,"Yes I'm lonely wanna die
Yes I'm lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.
In the morning wanna die
In the evening wanna die

If I ain't dead already

Ooh girl you know the reason why.



My mother was of the sky

My father was of the earth

But I am of the universe

And you know what it's worth

I'm lonely wanna die

If I ain't dead already

Ooh girl you know the reason why.



The eagle picks my eye

The worm he licks my bone

I feel so suicidal

Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

Lonely wanna die

If I ain't dead already

Ooh girl you know the reason why.



Black cloud crossed my mind

Blue mist round my soul

Feel so suicidal

Even hate my rock and roll

Wanna die yeah wanna die

If I ain't dead already

Ooh girl you know the reason why."
868,George Harrison,Isn't It A Pity,sad,"Isn't it a pity
Now, isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore

Forgetting to give back

Isn't it a pity



Some things take so long

But how do I explain

When not too many people

Can see we're all the same

And because of all their tears

Their eyes can't hope to see

The beauty that surrounds them

Isn't it a pity



Isn't it a pity

Isn't is a shame

How we break each other's hearts

And cause each other pain

How we take each other's love

Without thinking anymore

Forgetting to give back

Isn't it a pity



Forgetting to give back

Isn't it a pity

Forgetting to give back

Now, isn't it a pity

You'll just tear it apart

You got every advantage when they put out the lights

It's not so pretty when it fades away

Cause it's just an illusion in this passion play

I've seen you burn `em before

You're an expert in the field, without a doubt

But I know your methods inside and out

And I won't be takin' in by Fire and Ice

For all your time

Playful crawling rate

Worth it being cold?

Roofing for the lanes

A lesson lost again.

Lesson lost again.



Keep haunting the bus

With fees of favors gone

Cracks and sailors fast

And await the sun to show

Won't tomorrow come?

i'm sorry i have to be this

brutally honest, nicole

but my excuses were babies

of snow that i just could not hold



so you pick up your asthma inhaler

and put it against your lips

and oh those lips i've loved

that i was dreaming of

they're so red and soft

i'm so sorry i couldn't love you enough

i'm so sorry i couldn't love you enough

i'm so sorry that i'm leaving you

because i don't love you

There's sap in the trees if you tap 'em
There's blood on the seas if you map 'em
Christian, if you see your papa, tell him I love him
He taught me to love in the wild and fight in the gym
He taught me the bottle gives birth to the cup
And you won't get hurt if you just keep your hands up
And stand tall like sycamores
Like sycamores
Like sycamores

[Verse 2]
Sycamore got to grow down to grow up
Young roots toil the soil like baby's first cup
And when they bend you in two
And say too green for the fire
When all you want to do is be a part of the fire
All you want to do is be the fire part of fire
Like sycamores
Like sycamores
Like sycamores

[Verse 3]
There's sap in the trees if you tap 'em
There's blood on the seas if you map 'em
Christian, when I see your papa, I'll tell him you love him
And remember to love in the wild and fight in the gym
Remember the bottle gives birth to the cup
And you won't get hurt if you just keep your hands up
And stand tall like sycamores

I know my faults

I still keep my baby teeth

in the bedside table with my jewelry

you still sleep in the bed with me,

my jewelry, and my baby teeth



I don't need another friend

When most of them

I can barely keep up with them

perfectly able to hold my own hand,

but I still can't kiss my own neck.



I wanted to give you everything

but I still stand in awe of superficial things

I wanted to love you like my mother's mother's mothers did

When you feel your soul drop to the floor 

Like a hole like an open bleeding sore 

Then you'll have bled like I've bled 

Then you'll have wept as I've wept 



Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll 

Let's hit the bar, let's lose control 

One false move; you took me home 

One false move; you're all alone 



But it looks so good and it feels so nice 

I've paid my price 

I'll cut you out just to hear you scream: 

""Get away from, get away from me"". 

And I can feel my heart beat racing 

As I realize what I must do 

Get away from, get away from, get away from you.

I should've turned and ran like hell 

And I say we're through 

Should've turned around like hell

You bring me joy
When I'm down
So much joy
When I lose my way your love comes smiling on me

I saw your face

And then I knew

We would be friends

I was so afraid, but your arms, they'd say 'come to me'



So I'd say to you

?Can we talk for a while??

You'd say ?alright?

When you love me, I smile

I feel your hands and you feel mine

You bring me joy



You bring me joy

Don't go too far away

If I can't see your face, I will remember that smile



But can this be right

Or should we be friends

I get lonely sometimes and I'm mixed up again

'Cause you're the finest thing I've seen in all my life

You bring me joy



My joy, my joy

I believe this is gonna be what you want it to be

I just love you, I just love you, can't you see

That you're the best I've seen in all my life

You bring me joy



My joy...you're my joy

My joy...my, my joy



Thank you, baby, thank you, baby

I just love you, baby

When I lose my way, your love comes smiling on me"
890,Anita Baker,Good Love,happy,"(Gary Taylor)
Ah, many days it goes unspoken
But this desire never seems to go away
It's gonna take much more than hope to bring you close
I think I'll pray



I hear you say you've got a lot to give up

And there is so much more this heart of mine can take

If what you have to bring to me is positive you send it right away

Right away



Chorus I: I want to know what good love feels like

Good love, good love

I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time

I want to know what good love feels like

Good love, good love

Morning, noon and night, forever all my life

Good love, good love

Good love, good love

There is a void that stands between us

And it seems it's getting harder to relate

Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine

Life this way

Chorus II: I want to know what good love feels like

I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time

The reason for this wrath bestowed by flame beyond the sea.

Tonight I've heard the cry and swear by all I've seen,

Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Bridge]
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all
All

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction

You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were
We wouldn't be in this place tonight
Lost and lonely, scared and confused

We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight

Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues

We both got scars from the hell we been thru

Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose



So let's roll the dice, one more time

Take a chance on love again tonight

Risk it all, lay it on the line

Let the skeletons fight for life

Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide



Reconnected, feelin' no pain

Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)

Worn and weathered, scared to go home

We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)

And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused

The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now

Most people don't, but some people do



So let's roll the dice, one more time

Take a chance on love again tonight

Risk it all, lay it on the line

Let the skeletons fight for life

Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide"

Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war

First-class and second-class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes

That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued

I cheated on my taxes
Burned bridges
Ground axes

I stole dope

Left scars

Killed hope



What kind of man do you think I am

One twist and I'd do it all again

What kind of man got these holes in his mind

Do the same thing over and over again

Expecting something different this time

What kind of man do you think I am



I'm living in your house

I'm holding your hand

Sleeping in your bed

Cooking in your pan



You see the man who loves you

You see the man you love

But I have hidden claws

Inside these gloves



What kind of man do you think I am

One twist and I'd do it all again

What kind of man got these holes in his mind

Do the same thing over and over again

Expecting it be different this time

What kind of man do you think I am



Come clean and stand tall

To thee thyne own self be true

But sometimes I don't know

Who's foolin' who



It's not my place to question

Not my place to know

Now tell me

What kind of man gonna run this kind of show



What kind of man do you think I am babe

Another thing comin' if you think I can babe

Pick you up every chance I get

Well, I broke your heart for no other reason

Than my mind was already set

Oh, what kind of man



What kind of man do you think I am

What kind of man do you think I am

Oh, what kind of man"

You know you came into the room alone

But when you left 

Then I found that you took my heart

It sounds so corny yes I know it does

But truth is the shade that I choose to wear



I live and love with you

Every government must pass down a law

That says the sun has to always shine 

That everybody gets the chance to say

Nothing but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds from now on

I never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my, my, how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on

Looking at me

Blue skies looking at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds from now on

Never saw things goin' so right

917,Roy Milton,Thrill Me,happy,"OK, I'm the one who took you for granted
I've made my mistakes, wake up let's not
Break up

Thrill me you've got a love so strong
Thrill me you really turn me on

Thrill me wait till tomorrow night

Thrill me I'm gonna treat you right



You said that I would never let you be alone

How many times have you been on your own

Worked all the days to find the things you try to do

If only my heart will never let you through

Because you



Thrill me you've got a love so strong

Thrill me you just can't do me wrong

Thrill me wait till tomorrow night

Thrill me I'm gonna treat you right



The truth is you've gone and left me on my own

How can I face the fact you're really gone

Love was a phase we'd have to pray to make it true

If only my heart would've never let you through

Because you



Thrill me you've got a love so strong

Thrill me you really turn me on

Thrill me wait till tomorrow night

Thrill me I'm gonna treat you right"

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if

I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street
at Heartbreak Hotel.
You make me so lonely baby,

I get so lonely,

I get so lonely I could die.



And although it's always crowded,

you still can find some room.

Where broken hearted lovers

do cry away their gloom.



You make me so lonely baby,

I get so lonely,

I get so lonely I could die.



Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',

and the desk clerk's dressed in black.

Well they been so long on lonely street

They ain't ever gonna look back.

I get so lonely I could die.



Hey now, if your baby leaves you,

and you got a tale to tell.

Just take a walk down lonely street

to Heartbreak Hotel."

You see I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad

If you only knew what I'm going through

I just can't smile without you



You came along just like a song

And brighten my day

Who would of believed that you where part of a dream

Now it all seems light years away



And now you know I can't smile without you

I can't smile without you

I can't laugh and I can't sing

I'm finding it hard to do anything

You see I feel sad when your sad

I feel glad when you're glad

If you only knew what I'm going through

I just can't smile



Now some people say happiness takes so very long to find

Well, I'm finding it hard leaving your love behind me



And you see I can't smile without you

I can't smile without you

I can't laugh and I can't sing

I'm finding it hard to do anything

You see I feel glad when you're glad

I feel sad when you're sad

If you only knew what I'm going through

I just can't smile without you"

After work, me and the boys
Go down to Killey's and we make some noise
Feed that old jukebox and play some air guitar
Well, and there's nothin' wrong with shootin' pool
And having some fun and acting a fool
But this time I won't be going where they are

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
And all day long, I've been dreamin' of holdin' her tight
Yeah, it's gonna be a sweet surrender
Candle light and love-me-tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight

[Verse 2]
The girl sure has been working hard
I thank she's ready for some R&R
Something to take her mind off everything
Champagne and a box of candy
A dozen roses might come in handy
To help loosen up those apron strings

Never thought gettin' burned could be so much fun 
Always comin' up with something new 
Yea, that woman taught me a thing or two 
She's on fire 
My baby's on fire 

We go out driving in my 6.6 yea 

Bypass the city head straight for the sticks 

Shut off the lights 

Turn off the key 

No sooner set the brake she jumps on top of me 

She's on fire 

My baby's on fire 

Now let it burn 

Ohhh yea 

I like it hot 

She's on fire 

My baby's on fire 

No time for friends, no time for rest 

Straight home from school, she starts to get undressed 

It's five below but it's hot down here 

I get so hot every time she comes near 

Turned on to love like it's the latest style 

I get a response from just a look with a smile 

She's like a bomb that's about to explode 

Just on touch and she begins to unload 

She's on fire 

My baby's on fire 

She takes me higher 

My baby's on fire 

She's on fire

Broken hearted people staring at me,

All searching 'cos they still believe,

Oh, love ain't no stranger



I was alone an' I needed love

So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of,

I heard no warning, but, a heart can tell

I'd feel the emptiness of love I know so well

But, when I read between the lines it's all the same

God must really love me"
945,Alan Jackson,Ring Of Fire,angry,"(originally by Johnny Cash)
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire



I fell into a burning ring of fire

I went down, down, down and the flames went higher

And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire

The ring of fire



I fell into a burning ring of fire

I went down, down, down and the flames went higher

And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire

The ring of fire



The taste of love is sweet

When hearts like ours meet

I fell for you like a child

Oh, but the fire went wild



I fell into a burning ring of fire

I went down, down, down and the flames went higher

And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire

The ring of fire



I fell into a burning ring of fire

I went down, down, down and the flames went higher

And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire

The ring of fire



And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire

The ring of fire

The ring of fire

The ring of fire"
946,David Kersh,Goodnight Sweetheart,relaxed,"Window seat, thirty-thousand feet above the ground
Blue moonbeams on silver wings brings me down
Slipping off my coat for the long night flight
I find a note she wrote last night
I can almost hear those words as I close my eyes

Goodnight sweetheart,

Sleep tight where ever you are

God hold you in His arms while we're apart

Though you're far away

Your love will stay tucked away here in my heart

Goodnight sweetheart

Sleep tight where ever you are



These days I leave the one who needs me more & more it seems

It's a high price that she pays for the dreams that I dream



So goodnight sweetheart,

Sleep tight where ever you are

God hold you in His arms while we're apart

Though you're far away

Your love will stay tucked away here in my heart

Goodnight sweetheart,

Sleep tight where ever you are

Goodnight sweetheart

sleep tight where ever you are"

O they tell me of a home far away;
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise,
O they tell me of an uncloudy day.
O the land of cloudless day,

O the land of an unclouded day,

O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise,

O they tell me of an uncloudy day.



O they tell me of a home where my friends have gone,

O they tell me of that land far away,

Where the tree of life in eternal bloom

Sheds its fragrance through the uncloudy day.



O the land of cloudless day,

O the land of an unclouded day,

O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise,

O they tell me of an uncloudy day.



O they tell me of a King in His beauty there,

And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold

Where He sits on the throne that is whiter than snow,

In the city that is made of gold.



O the land of cloudless day,

O the land of an unclouded day,

O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise,

O they tell me of an uncloudy day.



O they tell me that He smiles on His children there,

And His smile drives their sorrows all away;

And they tell me that no tears ever come again

In that lovely land of uncloudy day.



O the land of cloudless day,

O the land of an unclouded day,

O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise,

950,Reckless Kelly,Some People's Kids,angry,"Her daddy told her all the facts
His momma taught him how to act
at puberty they paid their dues
the pool-hall was the moulin rouge
and he likes her skirt

and she like his tight levi's

fanning flames of the fire

that burned higher than the fire in their eyes



Momma's downtown on her lips

Daddy's on a business trip 

a pinch from momma's treasure chest

daddy comes up with the rest



and some people's kids don't know how fast time flies

now their paying for the fire burning higher than the fire in their eyes



some peoples kids can't see

all some people's kids really need

is someone to be there

to love 'em and to care, about them



daddy was a rollin' stone

momma chose to live alone

susie's out there on the wine

jimmy was friend of mine



and some peoples kids gotta sing so it's no surprise

that the flame of the fire's burnin' higher than the fire in their eyes

Hard to get home with any pride

And you never see his face 

But there is no hiding place

They get more respectable every day 

Don't worry girl, I'm gonna stick by you 

And someday soon we're gonna get in that 

car and get outta here

Watch the working girls go by 

Watch the ""basket people"" walk around and 

mumble 

And gaze out at the auburn sky 

Maybe we'll leave come springtime 

Meanwhile, have another beer 

What would we do without these jerks

Well look who's dying now

Slit wrists sleeping with the girl next door

I always knew you were such a sucker for that

It doesn't matter what you say

You never mattered anyway

Never mattered anyway



In this moment that we both ignore the truth

It's all over

This is time for discipline,
No mercy for a war whore.
Life turns harsh,

But lust does not disappear,

Life turns dark,

But attraction is still there.

To taste the forbidden,

To dance with the wolves,

Erotic deceit,

Pleasure above rules.



This is times of battle,

This is times of war,

This is time for discipline,

No mercy for a war whore.



This game, this flirt, will come to an end

Power will change,

Our nation will rise again,

The hordes will scream for your death,

They will claim revenge,

They will ravage your body,

They will serve you hell.



Spitting in the eyes of your defenders,

With open legs you surrender,

Embracing the muscular overpower,

Our pride you so simply devour.



It is time of battle,

It is time of war,

It is time to be disciplined,

No mercy for a war whore."

Hiding things that no one wants to find
I don't know much of that

Floating high above the trees one night
Thought it was an alien
Turned out to be just God

You had your fingers crossed instead

Really do come true
Some day I'll wish upon a star

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me

Where troubles melt like lemon drops

Away above the chimney tops

That's where you'll find me

somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly

Birds fly over the rainbow why then oh why can't I?

Someday I'll wish upon a star

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me

Where troubles melt like lemon drops

Away above the chimney tops

Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

For your love 

I would go anywhere 

Just you tell me and I'll be right there

Like a star in the sky 

Is nothing to behold 

For minuscule is any light 

If it can't like you brighten up my soul

And I glow, I glow 

With just the thought of you 

I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

985,Serge Gainsbourg,Requiem Pour Un C...,sad,"Ecoute les orgues
Elles jouent pour toi
Il est terrible cet air là
J'espère que tu aimes
C'est assez beau non
C'est le requiem pour un con



Je l'ai composé spécialement pour toi

A ta mémoire de scélérat

C'est un joli thème

Tu ne trouves pas

Semblable à toi même

Pauvre con



Voici les orgues

Qui remettent ça

Faut qu't'apprennes par c?ur cet air là

Que tu n'aies pas même

Une hésitation

Sur le requiem pour un con



Quoi tu me regardes

Tu n'apprécies pas

Mais qu'est-ce qu'y a là dedans

Qui t'plaît pas

Pour moi c'est idem

Que ça t'plaise ou non

J'te l'rejoue quand même

Pauvre con



Ecoute les orgues

Elles jouent pour toi

Il est terrible cet air là

J'espère que tu aimes

C'est assez beau non

C'est le requiem pour un con



Je l'ai composé spécialement pour toi

A ta mémoire de scélérat

Sur ta figure blême

Aux murs des prisons

J'inscrirai moi-même : ""Pauvre con"""
986,Bebel Gilberto,Aganju,sad,"Te esperei na lua crescer
Ví cadeira boa sentei
Espirrei na tua gripei
Por ficar ao léo resfriei
Você me agradou me acertou

Me miseravou, me aqueceu

Me rasgou a roupa e valeu

E jurou conversas de deus

988,Tinsley Ellis,Speak No Evil,angry,"1 ContributorSpeak No Evil LyricsDon't go around spreading rumours
Even if what you say is true
Before you go and tell your tales
You better think things true

So speak no evil, Evil won't happen to you

I've been mad enough to kill someone
But I couldn't face the task
So I tried to shout them down
With this big mouth of mine

So speak no evil, evil will get you in time

I've been about ..... that that shouldn't mess with you
Every time that I lied, you know I mean to tell the truth
No matter where I go , no matter what I do or say
Somebody gonna telling me, when they oughtta back away

Words thrown out in anger, always come back to haunt you
Once they go they told me, talk so hard to undo
So speak no evil, evil will come back to you
Better speak no evil, evil will come back to youYou might also likeEmbed

Pain, like the rain that's falling.
She waits in the air,
Matte Kudasai.
She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America.



When, when was the night so long,

Long, like the notes I'm sending.

She waits in the air,

Matte Kudasai.

She sleeps in a chair

In her sad America."

Going where the lonely go
Anywhere the lights are low
Going where the lonely go
Making up things to do

Not running in all directions

Trying to find you

I'm rollin with the flow

Going where the lonely go

I've got to keep rollin

I can't lay down



Sleep won't hardly come

When theres loneliness all around

I've got to keep goin

Travling down this lonesome road

I'm rollin with the flow

Goin where the lonely go"
991,Johnny Cash,Rusty Cage,sad,"You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil
But I'm gonna break

I'm gonna break my

I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run



Too cold to start a fire

I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones

I'll take the river down to still water

And ride a pack of dogs



I'm gonna break

I'm gonna break my

I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run



Hits like a Phillips head Into my brain

It's gonna be too dark

To sleep again Cutting my teeth on bars

And rusty chains,

I'm gonna break my Rusty cage and run



When the forest burns

Along the road Like God's eyes In my headlights

When the dogs are looking

For their bones

And it's raining icepicks

On your steel shore



I'm gonna break

I'm gonna break my

I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run"

Roaming 'round your house, wasting your time

Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster

Breathing smoke and fire

Closing in with vengeance soaring high



He is the Painkiller

This is the Painkiller



Planets devastated

Mankind's on its knees

A saviour comes from out the skies

In answer to their pleas



Through boiling clouds of thunder

Blasting bolts of steel

Evils going under deadly wheels



He is the Painkiller

This is the Painkiller



Faster than a laser bullet

Louder than an atom bomb

Chromium plated boiling metal

Brighter than a thousand suns



Flying high on rapture

Stronger free and brave

Nevermore encaptured

They've been brought back from the grave



With mankind resurrected

Forever to survive

Returns from Armageddon to the skies



He is the Painkiller

This is the Painkiller

Wings of steel Painkiller

Deadly wheels Painkiller"
994,Mr. Big,Addicted To That Rush,sad,"When I was a young boy
My momma said to me
Once a woman gets your soul
You'll never shake her free
These are words of wisdom 
Tt turns out she was right

Gotta find a lover-

'Cause I need a fix tonight



Once I thought her lovin'

Was a habit I could break

But when I go without it

My body starts to ache

Whoooooo (etc.) ooooo

Watch it touch me deep inside

Whoooooo

Somethin' snaps inside my mind

When I feel it comin' ain't no sense in runnin'

I'm addicted to that rush 

Every time we touch

Never get enough 

'Cause I'm addicted to that rush - Yeow!



Look around I stop and stare

Got to get a taste

Pretty women everywhere

We ain't got time to waste

Lookin' for a little thang 

To fit into my plans

On the town I'll hurt you down

I'm walkin' like a man

995,The Rolling Stones,Hang Fire,angry,"In the sweet old country where I come from 
Nobody ever works 
Yeah nothing gets done 
We hang fire, we hang fire 
You know marrying money is a full time job 

I don't need the aggravation 

I'm a lazy slob 

I hang fire, I hang fire 

Hang fire, put it on the wire 



We've got nothing to eat 

We got nowhere to work 

Nothing to drink 

We just lost our shirts 

I'm on the dole 

We ain't for hire 

Say what the hell 

Say what the hell, hang fire 

Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire 

Doo doo doo 



Take a thousand dollars go have some fun 

Put it all on at a hundred to one 

Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire"

We could watch it from the clouds

We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours.

We could watch it from the clouds

We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours.

It's not ours.



And I know you know me well enough to know I'm lucky to have you.

But all this just the little things, the words that I should tell you all the time.

You're so sweet to me when you beat me in doubles solitaire.

You're so sweet to me in a world that's not always fair.

We could watch it from the clouds

We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours.

We could watch it from the clouds

We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours.



More that you feel

More your little heart will ache.

Love's the only thing that carries on

It's the only thing this world can't take.

This love is ours.

This love is ours.

I was stranded on the fault line
I got wasted on the moonshine
Too far gone
I was walking in the sundown

I was heading for the breakdown

When you're sleeping on the cold ground

Too far gone



There was a cloud hanging over me

Something just reached out and grabbed a hold of me



Inside of the belly of the whale

Outside they was beatin on the door

Somebody goin down tonight

I said boys he don't live here no more

He don't live here no more



I was riding on the night train

I been moving in the fast lane

I was only trying to kill the pain

Too far gone



I was running on a red light

Always looking for a street fight

I was higher than a lost kite

Too far gone



When you're waiting for the axe to drop

When you're hooked so bad you could not stop



Inside of the belly of the whale

Outside they was beatin on the door

Somebody goin down tonight

I said boys he don't live here no more

He don't live here no more



Got no one to blame but myself

They couldn't hear my distant cry for help

Outside they was beatin on the door

He don't live here no more"

I'm wondering why
These little black clouds
Keep walking around
With me
With me



It wastes time

And I'd rather be high

Think I'll walk me outside

And buy a rainbow smile

But be free

They're all free



So maybe tomorrow

I'll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow

I'll find my way home



I look around at a beautiful life

Been the upperside of down

Been the inside of out

But we breathe

We breathe



I wanna breeze and an open mind

I wanna swim in the ocean

Wanna take my time for me

All me



So maybe tomorrow

I'll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow

I'll find my way home

I'll find my way home

That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just don't care
You look as if you're going somewhere
But I just can't convince myself

I couldn't live with no one else

And I can only play that part

And sit and nurse my broken heart



So lonely (x11)



Now no one's knocked upon my door

For a thousand years or more

All made up and nowhere to go

Welcome to this one man show



Just take a seat they're always free

No surprise no mystery

In this theatre that I call my soul

I always play the starring role



So lonely (x11)



Lonely, I'm so lonely

I feel so alone

I feel low

I feel so

Feel so low

I feel low, low

I feel low, low, low

Low, I feel low

And now that I'm here no one can ever erase
The joy that I feel way down deep beside
The love that I have for me will never, never die
I can see in color the first sign of spring

The rose buds are blooming

I got a new song, new song to sing



Life looks so amazing

I never knew that it could open my eyes

And for the very, very first time I can see in color



Everything looks beautiful, sky so baby blue

I'm anxious to know where the rest of this road will go

If April showers bring flowers then I need, I need more rain

To quench the drought in me, so rain on me, rain on me



I can see in color the first sign of spring

The rose buds are blooming

I got a new song, a new song to sing



Life looks so amazing

I never knew that it could open, open my, open my eyes

And for the very, very first time I can see



I can see in color the first sign, the first signs of spring

It looks so beautiful to me

I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see in color

Sky so baby blue, so baby blue



I can see, I can see

I can see in color the first sign of spring

And now the rose buds are blooming



I can touch them, I can feel them

I'm a hold them forever and ever and ever and ever

And ever, I'm a hold 'em ever, I'm a be forever



I can see, I can see, I can see

I can see, I can see, I can see

I can see, see in color, color, color, color

It's all clear"

I have got a feeling that you're gonna like it

What I'm doing to you

And I'm doing what I'm doing

I'll be doing what you want to me to do



Love is shining

Life is thriving in the good life

Good life



A feeling that you get from the good life

Once you get that good life feeling

Let me tell you no one can take it away

No, no

No, no



No more bad times

Only glad times in the good life

Good life



When the grooves are rocking nothing feels as good as a good life

I want you to want me

To want the good life all night



No more rainy days

The sun will chase the clouds away

In the good life

Good life



No more sorrow

Nothing borrowed in the good life

El hombre esta acercándose
Hacia el encuentro con la frontera
Un cambio, una decisión
La puerta abierta de una nueva era

El mundo que gira al revés
Pretende que navegue en él
Ahogando mis ideas

El ruido, ambiente y soledad
De la ciudad nos aíslan de todo
Por eso comencé a escarbar
Para encontrar los mil y un tesoros

El mundo que gira al revés
Pretende sumergirme en él
Ahogando mis ideas

Aquí tengo el presentimiento
Que aquí nada voy a arrastrar desde aquí
Solo voy a vivir mi hoy ahora

Lamento hay en mi corazón
No es imaginación, es verdadero
Mientras el tiempo anuncia que
Por un segundo casi fui un señuelo
You might also likeEl mundo que gira al revés

Solo voy a vivir mi hoy ahora

Cuando hasta un ciego puede ver
Que nos callamos sin saber

Que le hace falta a esta noche blanca 
A nuestras vidas, que ya han vivido tanto
Que han visto mil colores, de sabanas de seda 
Y cuando llueve, te gusta caminar 

Vas abrazándome, sin prisa aunque te mojes 

Amor mío, lo nuestro es como es 

Es toda una aventura, no le hace falta nada 



Estoy aquí, tan enamorado de ti 

Qué la noche dura una poco más 

El grito de una ciudad

Que ven nuestras caras, la humedad 



Y te haré compañía, más allá de la vida

Yo te juro que arriba te amare más 

Tan enamorados qué así 

La noche dura un poco más 



La mañana nos traerá 

Un canto nuevo, de pájaros alegres 

Amor mío, así es la vida juntos 

Dos locos de repente, sonriendole 

A la gente que nos ve pasar 



Tan enamorados qué así 

La noche dura un poco más 

Viajar a tu lado en el tren 

Un sueño difícil de creer

Poco a poco el abrazo 

Boca a boca despacio 

Aliento y suspiros tibios 

Anochecer 



Tan enamorados qué así 

La noche dura un poco más



Viajar a tu lado en el tren 

Un sueño difícil de creer"

And just so you know your skin is scaling

Have you fucked all the stray kids yet?
They're there sleeping in my backyard
They're just looking out for no one
Except to smoke and have some good fun
With their dogs and wives and new sons
And they probably never will hug
'cause she's never really found love
Just a woman who will always love
Just a unhappy with a man

And what I, and what I found is that we
We're all just sleeping around

His daughter used to come here

With her daughter and her husband
Now no one sees her husband
'Cause her ass has caught the harvest
And her pants have got a good fill
I know the suns beneath the window sill

Static cool

A little blink, yea, that's my prize

Sittin right there by her side

Hard to ignore

Hard to disguise

She'll never ever

Realize...

And it hurts all the time when you don't return my calls

I can't sleep, I can't dream 

An aversion to light 

Got a fear of the ocean 



Like drinking poison, like eating glass

Come and show me how it was

Been walking into the walls again

Starin at the stars through a backstreet door,
She tries and tries to make it all work out,

In a lonely night,

And in the pourin rain,

When shes alone at night,

Sometimes she weaps,

When she's feelin cold and weak,

Sometimes the pain,

It just tears her up inside,

Sometimes she cries,

Ooh, I wonder why,



Lisa don't have a lover no more,

Plays with her pillow,

Stares at the bedroom floor,

Used to have a million,

They've come and gone,

No matter what she does,

She can't figure out what she's doin' wrong,

In a lonely night,

And in the pourin rain,

Liven, loven, given everything you've got,

After all the heartache,

Maybe give it all just one more shot yeah,

Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love



She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down

And when I come to her when the sun goes down

Take away my trouble, take away my grief

Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the daytime

Yes I need her in the night

Yes I want to throw my arms around her

Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight



And when I'm returning from so far away

She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day

Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole

Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul

Hey baby, how you doin'?
Wow, it's really been a long time, you know?
Remember that night?
You remember

[Verse 1: Teena Marie]
On a starry winter night in Portugal
Where the ocean kissed the southern shore
There a dream I never thought would come to pass
Came and went like time slipped through an hourglass

[Pre-Chorus: Teena Marie]
You made love to me like fire and rain
Ooh, you know you got to be a hurricane
Killing me with kisses so so subtly
You made love forever, baby
You made love forever

For the strength to stay away
In and out, out and in you go
I feel your fire
Then I lose my self control


How can I ease the pain

When I know you're coming back again

How can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain



Every time that I let you in

You take away something deep within

A fool for love is a fool for pain

But I refuse to love you again



How can I ease the pain

When I know you're coming back again

How can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain



If it's not love you've come here for

Tell me, baby, why you're here

Knock, knock, knocking at my door

I can't take it

No more, no more, no more, no more, baby

Give me all or nothing at all



How can I ease the pain

How can I ease the pain in my heart

1074,Lamb Of God,Black Label,angry,"The human condition is inherit claustrophobia.
Compression of my space made complete.
I would rip out my own entrails by hand just to be alone.
Inanity rolls total through this sphere. 
Ostracized for clarity of vision. 
A dream unrealized of solitude that I should descend into autonomy

& know the pain of fellowship no more. I feel nothing but a lack of space.

Paradox of socialization results in duress.

Rife with hostility, what has caused me so much hate?

Humanity. Exterminate with extreme prejudice."

But he's all the man that I need



And in the morning when I kiss his eyes

He takes me down and rocks me slow

And in the evening when the moon is high

He holds me close and won't let go, he won't let go



He fills me up, he gives me love

Now the accusations must be paid with the strain of losing you, pain of feeling blue.
You're hurt and I'm lost,
Tell me what are we gonna do?



Please come back and kiss away the pain; we can be happy once again.

Please come back and kiss away the pain; we can make sunshine from the rain.



Without you, my life has no music.

Rhyme and rhythm cease to be.

Close friends tell me that you're acting heartsick,

Is it all because you're missing me?

The pain is clouding your eyes

Pain too deep to disguise

You're blue, baby I am too.

Tell me, tell me, tell me what are we gonna do?



Please come back and kiss away the pain; we can be happy once again.

Please come back and kiss away the pain; we can make sunshine from the rain.



Please come back baby, please come back baby, kiss it away.

We don't even have to explain, please come back and kiss away my pain.

Lost love is such a shame.



Your kiss is guaranteed to take all the pain, take all the pain, take all the pain away from me.



Please come kiss away the pain

1088,Ed Bruce,The Last Cowboy Song,sad,"This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost
He rides a feed lot and clerks in a market on weekends selling tobacco and beer
His dreams of tomorrow surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark

And eyeball to eyeball Ol' Wyatt backed down

He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas

And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song...



Remington showed us how he looked on canvas

And Louie L'Amore has told us his tale

And Willie and Waylon and me sing about him

And wish to God we could have ridden his trail



The Old Chisholm Trail is covered in concrete now

And they truck 'em to market in fifty foot rigs

They blow by his market never slowing to reason

Like living and dying was all he did

This is the last cowboy song...

This is the last cowboy song...

[ guitar ]

This is the last cowboy song..."

Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head
They connect

With the fall of man

They breathe you in

And dive as deep as they can



There's nothing you can do for them

They are the force between

When the sunlight is arising



There's nothing you can say to him

He is an outer heart

And the space has been broken



Broken

Our love

Broken



Is it far away in the

Glitter Freeze

Or in our eyes

Every time they leave



It's by the light

Of the plasma springs

We keep switched on

All through the night while we sleep



There's nothing you can do for them

They are the force between

When the sunlight is arising



There's nothing you can say to her

I am without a heart

And the space has been broken



Broken

Our love

Broken

I need you in my life, my life, my life

[Verse 1: Mr. Capone-E (Snoop Dogg in cellphone)]
Early in the morning, wakin' up to the beat
It's a good old day, got a kiss on my cheek {*smooch*}
Feeling like a boss, so I get fresh dressed
Diary of a G, and we ain't having that stress
Movin' like I'm doin', so I'm getting paid
Snoop Dogg called me up, and you know he's on the way (What's crack-a-lackin')
Out my way, so I bounce to the store
With some Don Diego's, what I'm looking for
Party time, are you the fire I desire
Without you, girl
My life would expire
So sing to me, baby, I'm a sing to you
Stay true to me lady, I'll stay true to you
Up at the spot
You elevate my mind
And guess what
You're just my kind
Rain or shine
You always got my back
Take me to cloud nine
Just like that

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, you take me higher
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, just light my fire

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Bigg Snoop Dogg, here to twist the dro
Put the pedal to the metal, go against the flow
High powered as the label, Mr. Criminal
Capone
Young loc, let me hit that, holmes
Lady Pink
The first lady, D-O-Dub
West coast to the fullest, tryin' to show y'all love
No doubt, Dogg House tryin' to burn one out
If I see a little freak, I'm a turn one out
Get in the Coup
Smash out in my Porshe
Ballin', of course
Next level
Hand on the wheel
Pressin' on the pedal
Do what the pimp say
Baby, caliente
So cool
Way smooth
Check this fool
Stop by, slip by, way fly, on the low
Stole the show, what it do, brand new, deja vu
Me and you, baby boo, what it do

Repeat Chorus

Break: Mr. Capone-E
I need you girl like I need this lighter
Come on, baby, just light my fire
Just light it with me, just light this fire
Come and light it with me, just light this fire
Bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
If you down with the G
I said, bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Snoop Dogg and Capone with the E

[Verse 3: Mr. Capone-E]
We stay lit
Just another radio hit
To bump while you twist it
I'm with the business
Oh
We do what we desire
Come on, baby, just light my fire

[Fingazz]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, you take me higher

And there will be an end to these troubles

Dile al que te pregunte que no te quise

Dile que te engañaba que fui lo peor

And I've spent too much time doing
It's time to go

And I need fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

In my life

And I need life

In my fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun



Oh, I took a walk yesterday all around New York City

And I saw something written on a car

It said ""The less you own the more freedom you have""

The less you own the more freedom you have

So I went home and I threw it all away"

Why I just grin like a clown

My kind of razzmatazz

She crossed the Sally Gardens, with little snow-white feet.
She bid me to take life easy, as the leaves grow on the tree,
But I was young and foolish, and with her I did not agree.
In a field down by the river, my love and I did stand

And upon my leaning shoulder, she laid her snow-white hand.

She bid me to take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs,

But I was young and foolish, and now I am full of tears.

Go all the way to the right

I'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lights.



Chorus

Hit the streets

They talk to me

A fickle beast who's nice today

It's such a waste, another day

Such a waste, But it feels great 

But it feels great



It feels great



Everything has taken a turn

In disguise as what I want

I can leave her

I cantilever

But I keep coming back for more



I'm turning into something

Go all the way to the right

I'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lights

It may be a waste

Another day

No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
But I don't mind cause baby I got you

The rain kees the flowers from dyin'

The sun lights the world when its shinin'

The midnight sky has a blanket of start and a moon

And baby I got you

Life alone just wouldn't be worth livin'

Love would be a wish that never came true

Lord knows I've got more than I deserve

Bt I don't question the prayer that I've had ansered

Death and hatred to mankind 

Poisoning their brainwashed minds, Oh Lord yeah

They only started the war 

Why should they go out to fight 

They leave that all to the poor 

Time will tell on their power minds 

Making war just for fun 

Treating people just like pawns in chess 

Wait til the judgement day comes 

Now in darkness world stops turning 

Asher where the bodies burning 

No more warpigs have the power 

And as God has struck the hour 

Day of judgement, God is calling 

On their knees the warpigs crawling 

Begging mercy for their sins

1140,Melba Moore,Time To Come Home ,relaxed,"12 ContributorsTime to Come Home Lyrics[Intro: Lil Zane & T-Bone]
Ah Yeah
Time to come back home y`all
Come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Lil Zane, T-Bone, Both]
For God I`m a slave To get to heaven Reverend said I gotta be saved
And behave And also stuck in my ways Give Him praise
Words can't express what I feel inside of my flesh
Every breath is giving Him glory until my death (I feel blessed)
Cuz everyday I`m seeing Him work (I feel blessed)
I don't wanna do no more dirt (I feel blessed)
'Cause the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It's time to come home

[Verse 2: Beyoncé, Melba Moore & Angie Stone]
It doesn't matter where you been or what you did wrong
It doesn't matter who you are, you're always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes and you confess
If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Angie Stone & Melba Moore]
Callin' on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)

1141,Incognito,Your Sun My Sky ,relaxed,"What is left for us to say between hello and goodbye
Any day now you'll close the door, and walk away
I'll be picking through the pieces and wondering how it came to this
If things don't go the way you want it
Well that's the way it goes

(Bridge)

These photographs remind me

Of all the things I said

And the promises I made you

On the day that we first met

But ain't that just like you baby

Ain't that just like you

Ain't that like you



Used to be your sun in my sky

It's all over and the days go by

Used to be your sun in my sky

It ain't been easy to slowly watch you go



I wonder if you know just what you're doin' to me

Knowing what we've been through before, what am I say

You've been acting strangely lately, so far away yet you're next to me

When things are not the way they should be

Gotta know when to let it go



(Bridge)



Used to be your sun in my sky

It's all over and the days go by

Used to be your sun in my sky

It ain't been easy to slowly watch you go



You been doing me wrong

But I'd have you back if it were mine to choose

You been doing me wrong

But I'd still have you back if it were mine to choose

Used to be your sun in my sky

It's all over and the days go by

Used to be your sun in my sky

It ain't been easy to slowly watch you go



Used to be your sun in my sky

Till the clouds came over and the night set in

Used to be your sun in my sky

It ain't been easy to slowly watch you go, oh no"

Me muero sin tí
Que desde que huiste
La paso llorando sin fin
Y crees que no

No podré seguir

Que estoy deprimida

desde tu partida



Y yo la paso bailando

Cantando, lo van gozando sin ti

y tu estás imaginando

que paso mis noches en vela

muriendo por tí



y yo la paso bailando

amando mi vida irá ya sin ti

y cuando recuerdo tu nombre 

y tus besos me rio de ti



te aviso que yo estoy mejor así

que cuando te fuiste

perdiste lo único bueno de ti

que nadie te dio 

lo que yo te di

y ahora tu vida ha quedado vacía sin mí



Y yo la paso bailando

Cantando, lo van gozando sin ti

y tu estás imaginando

que paso mis noches en vela

muriendo por tí



y yo la paso bailando

amando mi vida irá ya sin ti

y cuando recuerdo tu nombre

y tus besos me rio de ti



y juras que soy tan infeliz

que solo tus manos llenaban mi espacio

que no encontraría a nadie más para mí.



Y yo la paso bailando

Cantando, lo van gozando sin ti

y tu estás imaginando

que paso mis noches en vela

muriendo por tí



y yo la paso bailando

amando mi vida irá ya sin ti

y cuando recuerdo tu nombre

y tus besos me rio de ti



Y yo la paso bailando

Cantando, lo van gozando sin ti

y tu estás imaginando

que paso mis noches en vela

muriendo por tí



y yo la paso bailando

amando mi libertad ya sin ti

y cuando recuerdo tu nombre 

y tus besos me rio de ti

1144,Bury Your Dead,Twelfth Stroke Of Midnight,sad,"I can't read between the lines
Of a letter
That you've never written
I can't begin to compromise
On a problem
That you have invented



Dead stares cut a paper heart

And beats ink in these pages

Letters written in regret

To many lifeless faces

This is the end of me

I am running on empty



Hours spent pouring over these words

With nothing gained

All that was lost with nothing learned

I'm just feeling drained



This is taking so much out of me

I am doubting my place as of late



I wish I could make this

Paper heart come alive

All my time spent on

Writing this living lie

All my time spent on this lie

y repite el eco y el eco se va,

sin que nadie escuche tu risa tu hablar.

Te juro que no, te dejo jamas,

porque como estas, hoy me encuentro igual,

sin poder hallar quien le de de beber,

Te juro que no, te dejo jamas,

porque estaba loco, de tanto esperar,

y hoy que estas aqui vamos a saciar,

estas ansias locas que tengo de amar.



Si he sabido amor que te vuelvo a ver,

con tanta tristeza, con tanto dolor,con tantas heridas que el tiempo te dio,

con las alas rotas, roto el corazon.

I will bless You Lord because You've been so good
You have been my strength 
in the time of weakness
There''s never been a time 

I couldn't count on You

So I will bless You, oh, Lord, 

in the midst of the people



Come on somebody, 

right here, right now

We come to give Your name the glory

Somebody help me

Sisters tell me something, come on



Looked around the week was gone

Worked my fingers to the bone, 

I should've known

That the struggle I had faced wasn't over

Drama won't leave me alone



When the world all around me

gives me every reason to faint

My first and the last real defense 

is to stand and say



No matter what is going on

My God still sits upon the throne

I might get down but not for long

My praise will keep me moving on



Join in together like this, 

like this come on

Sisters tell me something else



Turned around I'd made it through

Wasn't sure of how I would

but Lord you knew 

That my strength would surely fade

but You'd cover 

And my joy you would renew



You know the enemy seeks and he roars 

with his plans to abuse

In the midst of his rage and his lies 

let us stand on the truth



No matter what is going on

My God still sits upon the throne

I might get down but not for long

My praise will keep me moving on



No matter what the circumstance 

I know my life is in his hands

The storms may come but not for long

My praise will keep me moving on



Now if I'm really honest I really gotta say 

That I get somewhat discouraged 

when trials come my way

But this will be my choice, 

will be my choice



No matter what the day may bring to you 

Keep praising God

Whether up or down, 

whether good or bad

Keep your praise always



No matter what the day may bring to you 

Keep praising God

Whether this or that 

just don't hold back

Keep your praise flowing



Keep on, keep praisin'

Keep on, keep praisin'

Keep on, keep praisin'

Keep on praisin'



No matter what the day may bring to you 

Keep praising God

Whether up or down, 

whether good or bad

Keep your praise always



No matter what the day may bring to you 

Keep praising God

Whether this or that 

just don't hold back

Keep your praise flowing



Keep on, keep praisin'

Keep on, keep praisin'

Keep on, keep praisin'

Keep on praisin'



Keep on, keep praisin'

Keep on, keep praisin'

Keep your praise always

Somebody put your hands together

When it seems like your world is going crazy

This is what you do

Get your praise, keep your praise, 

keep on praisin'



Keep on praisin'

Keep on praisin'

Keep on praisin' 

Keep on praisin'



Keep on praisin'

Keep on praisin'

Keep your praise always



Put your hands let me hear the horns play

When the world all around you 

is sinking sand

Somebody lift your hands and say 

I'm gonna praise Him anyway



Keep on praisin'

Keep on praisin'

Keep on praisin' 

Keep on praisin'



Keep on praisin'

Keep on praisin'

Keep your praise always

Going so slow, slow, slow
Just down below me is the old sea
Just down below me is the old sea
Nobody knows, knows, knows
So many things, things, so

So out of range

Sometimes so strange

Sometimes so sweet

Sometimes so lonely



The further I go

More letters from home never arrive

And I'm alone

All of the way

All of the way

Alone and alive



You just have to go, go, go

Where I don't know, know, know

This is the thing

Somebody told me

A long time ago



The further I go

More letters from home never arrive

And I'm alone

All of the way

All of the way

Alone and alive"

If you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

And if you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

And although it's always crowded,

you still can find some room.

Where broken hearted lovers

do cry away their gloom.



You make me so lonely baby,

I get so lonely,

I get so lonely I could die.



Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',

and the desk clerk's dressed in black.

Well they been so long on lonely street

They ain't ever gonna look back.

and you got a tale to tell.

Just take a walk down lonely street

It feels like a lifetime, a thousand days have passed 
by 
Since I held you close to me 
If I could see that smile from my friend 

I know that I could live again 

I need you here with me 



Heaven knows what to say 

Even though for right now youre so far away 

I hope and I pray 

Somewhere in your heart Ill always stay 



Girl, lately my sun doesnt shine without you 

Never noticed what it feels like to be without you 

Feels like I took my last step and my last breath in 

my life ending 

Had to say just what I was feeling, girl 

Cause my sun doesnt shine, sun doesnt shine without 

you 



This is more for me than for you 

Girl, I finally see theres no substitute 

For what we have 

Do you know how much I love you 



Heaven knows what to say 

Even though for right now youre so far away 

Gonna tell you and show you 

Do whatever I can do to get back to you 



Girl, lately my sun doesnt shine without you 

Never noticed what it feels like to be without you 

Feels like I took my last step and my last breath in 

my life ending 

Had to say just what I was feeling, girl 

Cause my sun doesnt shine, sun doesnt shine 

without you"

Scared of the dark and beign alone

Both are quite the circus where the killer wants his way

I think of Edward Teller and his moribund reprise

Then I look to Nevada and I can't believe my eyes

It's time for hime to die!

Most cannot remeber minutia learned in school

It's not there on the blackboard, it's what they don't tell you

We have got a problem, it starts and ends right here

It can be defeated but you've got to face your fear

We'll join and unite and steady our sight

Then we'll put it right `cuz it's time to fight

And some were merrily lovers

And I said no way, would I fall again oh no, no way

There's just too many heartaches

And I don't like the way it feels to feel my heart break

Then there was you



You're the best break this old heart ever had

You're all the good luck that I'll never need to have

Never thought I'd ever love again like that

You're the best break this old heart ever had



All around me

My world was crumbling down all around me

Oh but then you found me

And with your love you mended my life

Now we're fighting in our hearts

Fighting in the streets

It matters what you say, it matters what you do

Fighting in the streets

In this heart of mine, I'll find a place for you

For black or white, for grown-up children too

Now we're fighting in our hearts

Some people say
You've got to fight for a love that's true
Climb every mountain
To see every trial and tribulation through
And I'm here to tell you
Ooh, that's only half the lesson, yeah
Now if you want a girl to come to you
You've got to leave a little room for guessin', yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, just be easy, baby
That girl'll come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
Ah, she'll be easy, too

[Verse 2]
Don't you know it's just a fool who plays the part
Running a girl down like she's a game in a schoolyard?
Now if she waits, you should turn and let her alone
She'll come to you just as sure as you're born

[Chorus]
Be easy, baby
That girl'll come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
Ah, she'll be easy, too

You've got to be mettle if you want her affection

So be easy, baby

1242,Alejandro Sanz,Cuando Nadie Me Ve,sad,"A veces me elevo, doy mil volteretas
A veces me encierro tras puertas abiertas
A veces te cuento por qué este silencio
Y es que a veces soy tuyo y a veces del viento 
A veces de un hilo y a veces de un ciento
Y hay veces, mi vida, te juro que pienso:

¿Por qué es tan difícil sentir como siento?

Sentir ¡Como siento! Que sea difícil



A veces te miro y a veces te dejas

Me prestas tus alas, revisas tus huellas

A veces por todo aunque nunca me falles

A veces soy tuyo y a veces de nadie

A veces te juro de veras que siento,

no darte la vida entera, darte sólo esos momentos

¿Por qué es tan difícil?... Vivir sólo es eso...

Vivir, sólo es eso... ¿Por qué es tan difícil?



Cuando nadie me ve

puedo ser o no ser cuando nadie me ve

pongo el mundo del revés

cuando nadie me ve no me limita la piel

cuando nadie me ve

puedo ser o no ser

cuando nadie me ve



A veces me elevo, doy mil volteretas

me encierro en tus ojos tras puertas abiertas

A veces te cuento por qué este silencio

Y es que a veces soy tuyo y a veces del viento



Te escribo desde los centros de mi propia existencia

donde nacen las ansias la infinita esencia

hay cosas muy tuyas que yo no comprendo

y hay cosas tan mías pero es que yo no las veo

supongo que pienso que yo no las tengo

no entiendo mi vida, se encienden los versos

que a oscuras te puedo, lo siento no acierto

no enciendas las luces que tengo desnudos,

el alma y el cuerpo



Cuando nadie me ve

puedo ser o no ser

cuando nadie me ve

me parezco a tu piel

cuando nadie me ve

yo pienso en ella

también

cuando nadie me ve,

puedo ser o no ser

cuando nadie me ve,

puedo ser o no ser

cuando nadie me ve, no

me limita la piel



Cuando nadie me ve

puedo ser o no ser

cuando nadie me ve

no me limita la piel

puedo ser, puedo ser o no ser

cuando nadie me ve



A veces me elevo

doy mil volteretas

Te encierro en mis ojos

tras puertas abiertas

A veces te cuento por qué este silencio

Y es que a veces soy tuyo y a veces...

del viento

A veces del viento



Y a veces del tiempo

A veces del viento

Y a veces del tiempo"
1243,Elvis Costello,I Lost You,angry,"I Lost You
I Lost You
You slipped from your costume
Like an actress in this tragedy
You're just an apparition in a haunting mystery
I fear that you've passed over me...

And there's nothing I can do because

I Lost You



Just like a rich man who is careless of his change

I took you for granted

And then you went to strangers

From deep within my heart I feel a distant fading pulse

A poor woman looking for last coin in her purse



I Lost You

I Lost You

You slipped from your costume

Like an actress in this tragedy

You're just an apparition in a haunting mystery

I fear that you've passed over me...

And there's nothing I can do because

I Lost You



Just like a counterfeit you pass from palm to palm

I chased the one I surely loved to someone else's arms

I mislaid my senses, now that's easy to say

A fool who took his pleasure but then threw his love away



I Lost You

I Lost You

You slipped from your costume

Like an actress in this tragedy

You're just an apparition in a haunting mystery

I fear that you've passed over me...

And there's nothing I can do because

1244,The Replacements,Skyway,sad,"You take the skyway, high above the busy little one-way
In my stupid hat and gloves, at night I lie awake
Wonderin' if I'll sleep
Wonderin' if we'll meet out in the street
To take the skyway

It don't move at all like a subway

It's got bums when it's cold like any other place

It's warm up inside

Sittin' down and waitin' for a ride

Beneath the skyway



Oh, then one day, I saw you walkin' down that little one-way

Where, the place I'd catch my ride most everyday

There wasn't a damn thing I could do or say

Up in the skyway"
1245,Vampire Weekend,Mansard Roof,sad,"I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet
The hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too

The Argentines collapse in defeat

The admiralty surveys the remnants of the fleet

The ground beneath their feet

Is a nautically-mapped sheet

As thin as paper

While it slips away from view"

If I told you what it takes

to reach the highest high,

You'd laugh and say 'nothing's that simple'

But you've been told many times before

Messiahs pointed to the door

And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

And freedom tastes of reality

I'm free-I'm free

And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

Throw your job away

Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together

While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet

And if you're good
I'll search for wood
So you can cook while I stand looking

Crying for mama's arms
At an orphanage just outside a little China town
Where the forgotten are

But half a world away I hang the stockings by the fire
And dream about the day when I can finally call you mine

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

As I hang the tinsel on the tree and watch the twinkling lights
I'm warmed by the fire's glow
Outside the children tumble in the wonderland of white
And make angels in the snow

But half a world away you try your best to fight the tears
And hope that Heaven's Angels come to carry you here

Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms

I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you

And I think to myself, what a wonderful world



I see skies of blue and clouds of white

The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night

And I think to myself, what a wonderful world



The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky

Are also on the faces of people going by

I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' ""How do you do?""

They're really saying ""I love you""



I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow

They'll learn much more than I'll ever know

And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world"

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own



Marching in the streets

Dragging iron feet

Laser beaming hearts

Ripping men apart



From off I've seen my perfection

Where we could do as we please

In secrecy this infection

Was spreading like a disease



Hiding underground

Knowing we'd be found

Fearing for our lives

Reaped by robot's scythes



Metal Gods

Metal Gods



[Solo Glenn]



Metal Gods

Machines are taking all over

With mankind in their command

In time they'd like to discover

How they can make their demand



Better be the slaves

To their wicked ways

But meeting with our death

Engulfed in molten breath"

And it broke me in two

I'm in love with love

Look out baby, it's gonna break you too



I'd pull your ship across the ocean wide

Hold my breath

And dive dive dive

If they held me at the bottom

Then asked me why

I'd open my mouth and I'd tell em why 'cause



I'm in love with love

And it broke me in two

So look out baby, it's gonna break you too

We're saying our prayers

Two lovers in the mist

With the salt in their hair

And it broke me in two

I'm in love I'm in love

It's gonna break you too

Yes it will



The waves are breaking in a foreign tongue

Understand but I'm feeling numb.

If your love was a ship

I'd pull your anchor and hang on to it



I'm in love with love

And it broke me in two

I'm in love with love

So look out baby

It's gonna break you too

Writing letters

Lifting latches

Standing solo

Getting nowhere

1274,Eva Cassidy,Time After Time,sad,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion
Is nothing new
Flashback--warm nights
Almost left behind

Suitcases of memories

Time after



Sometimes you picture me

I'm walking too far ahead

You're calling to me, I can't hear

What you've said

Then you say--go slow

I fall behind

The second hand unwinds



Chorus

If you're lost you can look--and you will find me

Time after time

If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting

Time after time



After my picture fades and darkness has

Turned to gray

Watching through windows--you're wondering

If I'm OK

Secrets stolen from deep inside

The drum beats out of time--



Chorus



You said go slow--

I fall behind

The second hand unwinds--



Chorus



Time after time

Time after time 

Time after time

Time after time"

A journey that leads to the sun,
Soulless and bent on destruction,
A struggle between right and wrong.
You take my place in the showdown,

I'd humbly ask for forgiveness,

A request well beyond you and I.



Heart and soul, one will burn.

Heart and soul, one will burn.



An abyss that laughs at creation,

A circus complete with all fools,

Foundations that lasted the ages,

Then ripped apart at their roots.

Beyond all this good is the terror,

The grip of a mercenary hand,

When savagery turns all good reason,

There's no turning back, no last stand.



Heart and soul, one will burn.

Heart and soul, one will burn.



Existence well what does it matter?

I exist on the best terms I can.

The past is now part of my future,

The present is well out of hand.

A search that shall remain

We asked you what you'd seen

You said you didn't care



Sound formed in a vacuum 

May seem a waste of time

No movement no lyrics

Just nothing

The path we can not take

You've caught me at a bad time

So why don't you piss off"

I'm burning alive, burning alive

Down on the ground

I'm burning my love

I'm burning alive, burning alive

Down on the ground



How strange is your love

How warm is your love

How tough is your love

I'm falling in love

I'm falling down, falling down

Down on the ground

How warm is your love

1299,Eric Clapton,Bad Love,happy,"Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you
You take my heart into everything you do
And it makes me sad for the lonely people
I walked that road for so long
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
Your love is making me strong



I've had enough bad love

I need something I can be proud of

I've had enough bad love

No more bad love



And now I see that my life has been so blue

With all the heartaches I had till I met you

But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me

With you here by my side

And there's no more memories to remind me

Your love will keep me alive

What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there
What do I do to make you want me

What have I got to do to be heard

What do I say when it's all over

And sorry seems to be the hardest word



It's sad, so sad

It's a sad, sad situation

And it's getting more and more absurd

It's sad, so sad

Why can't we talk it over

Oh it seems to me

That sorry seems to be the hardest word



What do I do to make you love me

What have I got to do to be heard

What do I do when lightning strikes me

What have I got to do

What have I got to do

When sorry seems to be the hardest word"

A mental shakedown
See my hands, how they shiver
See my knees, how they quiver
My whole body's in a jitter
I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown

I went to see the doctor just the other day
I got to tell you what he had to say
Well, he said, ""Hey, boy, you just gotta slow down
You can't keep a-traipsin' all over town
After givin' you a physical check
I've come to the conclusion you're a total wreck""

I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown
A mental shakedown
See my hands, how they shiver
See my knees, how they quiver
My whole body's in a jitter
I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown

I've made up my mind, I'd better change my ways
My shattered nerves have seen better days
No more guys for a week or two
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew
No more movies or stayin' out late

Thought I could clear my mind

I took a plae out to find some truth

But all I've found I can't seem to leave behind



I dream of Chicago

I dream about you

I dream I could go and say all the things that I never said to you



I'm sure I used to love you

And I'm sure you made me such a fool

But you were solid with your heart and affections

Tell me, girl, what's a boy supposed to do?



I dream of Chicago

I dream about you

I dream I could go and say all the things that I never said to you

Yes it's so hard with so little time

And so much to do

Time running out for the family of man



One man to lead us with so much to say

Moving the mountains that got in our way

Prayer books and meetings to find a plan

Deciding the fate of the family of man



Memories replacing the loves that we've lost

Burning our bridges as soon as they're crossed

Factories built where the rivers ran

And time running out for the family of man"

The lonely nights I'll be without

Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows

Take your memory with you when you go



I walk the floor and wonder what went wrong

I'll have to find a way to carry on

Why don't you leave before the heartache starts to show

Take your memory with you when you go

Lo que me digas de memoria me lo se

tus mentiras no me serviran de nada

te lo perdiste ojala te vaya bien

yo me voy por donde vine

se que no me perdere

Abandonao un exciliado

de tu boca, de tus manos, de tu corazon

sin rumbo fijo voy de la mano

de mis sueños vagabundos 

y me importa poco que me diga el mundo

el abandonao

El tiempo es el doctor de los dolidos

para sanar las penas que te embriagan

yo siempre me las curo con tequila

oyendo a jose alfredo y al sabina

y no pasa nada se que no me morire

como dice la cancion asi es la vida

mirame a los ojos aunque sea la ultima vez

solo vine a despedirme no te vine a detener

Abandonao un exciliado

de tu boca, de tus manos, de tu corazon

sin rumbo fijo voy de la mano

de mis sueños vagabundos 

y me importa poco que me diga el mundo

el abandonao

Asi estoy yo sin

fallaste corazon

ya lo pasado, pasado

te doy una cancion

de que manera te olvido

esta tarde vi llover

besame besame mucho

porque la que se fue

Abandonao un exciliado

de tu boca, de tus manos, de tu corazon

sin rumbo fijo voy de la mano

de mis sueños vagabundos 

y me importa poco que me diga el mundo

el abandonao"
1316,Kenny Rogers,Love Lifted Me,happy,"I was sinking deep in sin, 
Far from the peaceful shore, 
Very deeply stained within, 


Sinking to rise no more. 



But the Master of the sea 







Heard my despairing cry, 



>From the waters lifted me. 



Now safe am I. 







Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 



When nothing else could help, 



Love lifted me. 



Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 



When nothing else could help 



Love lifted me. 







Souls in danger look above 



Jesus completely saves 



He will lift you by his love 



Out of the angry waves 







But the master of the sea 



Billows His will obey 



He your savior wants to be 



Be saved today 







Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 



When nothing else could help, 



Love lifted me. 



Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 



When nothing else could help 



Love lifted me."

Everything you wanted and needed in me

It's the last thing I want to do

But I don't have the heart to love you

Not the way you want me to

To see you crying

How can I make you understand

I care about you

So much about you, baby

I'm trying to say this as gently as I can



'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you

It's the last thing I want to do

But I don't have the heart to love you

Not the way you want me to



You're so trusting and open

Hoping that love will start

But I don't have the heart, oh, no

I don't have the heart



I don't have the heart to hurt you

You look so small you've gone so quiet

I know you know what I'm about

I won't deny it

But you forgive though you don't understand

You've turned your head

You've dropped by hand



All my sorrow, all my blues

Shut the light, go away

Full of grace, you cover your face

I know angry tears are too dear

lose myself ..
i used to do it for the love a long time ago
when all i ever want it was love

i used to love without fear

when all i ever want was love

and somebody came around and tried to hurt me

try to make me feel like i was unworthy

took a pill love and tried to make it dirty

truth was they never did deserve me

no!



[Chorus:]

i had to lose myself so i could love you better

i had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could

love you better, lose myself in love

and that's just the way it is...

couldn't tell me i was love when i needed it

when, all i ever wanted was love.

should a told me i was worth receiving it

but all i ever wanted was love

there's is something awkward about the selflessness it

takes to

give love and the good that it makes you!

true love can never really forsake you

but it took a little while just for me to see!



[Chorus:]

i had to lose myself so i could love you better

i had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could

love you better

had to lose myself, had to lose myself

so i could love you better

had to lose myself in love

and that's just the way it is...

i had a paralyzing fear of facing failure

and i couldn't love you perfectly with fear in my head

so i peerlessly had to face the danger

so i could come back and love you whole instead

all of your soul i said!

so i could make it better



[Chorus:]

and so it goes that i never meant to hurt you

couldn't stay but i never meant to desert you

whole lot a things i just had to work through

time to heal and restore myself worth too

confrontation of my fears and anxiety

cried a whole lot years i suffered quietly

and though it may have taken years i can finally!

tell you that you were always on my mind!



[Chorus:]

i had to lose myself so i could make it better

i had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could

love you better

had to lose myself, had to lose myself

so i could make it better

had to lose myself in love

and that was just the way!



takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did

great love to absorb all the misuse i did

hey baby it's not an excuse i give.

and i'd do it all again because for you i live



takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did

great love to absorb all the abuse i did

hey baby it's not an excuse i give.

and i'd do it all again because for you i live



[Chorus:]

i had to lose myself so i could make it better

i had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could

make it better

had to lose myself, had to lose myself

i could make it better, i could make it better

i could make it better, i could make it better

To see my friend one last time

People gathered 'round

Some were prayin, some were cryin'

They were talkin' about heaven

And the final judgement day

But all I could do was say goodbye to him

Turn and walk away.



Yeah I went to the graveyard

But black sky was all I seen

Please stand beside me baby

Shine your light for me.



I wake up every mornin'

Try the best I can

To make it one more day

In a world I don't understand

Now the sun baby's shinin'

But there's darkness on the land

And I can't find my way baby

Unless you take my hand.



Yeah I, I wake up every mornin' baby

Black sky is all I see

Please stand beside me baby

Shine your light for me.



Yeah black sky

Black sky is all I see

Please shine your light pretty baby

Take this black sky away from me."

Ooo, I want love from you

From you I want love

Everytime I hear your song

I can't believe you're everything I need

Mama you can do no wrong



I wish I knew everything it takes to get along

Then we should take it easy or we will both be sorry

Then we should take it easy, take it easy

Or we both be sorry

Let's take it easy



Sometimes I think about what I would do without

Who knew we could be such friends?

Dreaming of your love and warm and touch

When can I see you again?



Up all night I shiver with delight

Everytime I hear your song

Dizzy with anticipation

How's everything coming along?



I wish I could do whatever it takes to get along

Then we should take it easy or we will both be sorry

Then we should take it easy, take it easy

Or we will both be sorry, or we will both be sorry"
1340,Elliott Smith,Needle In The Hay,sad,"Your hand on his arm
The hay stack charm around your neck
Strung out and thin
Calling some friend trying to cash some check
He's acting dumb
That's what you've come to expect

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay

He's wearing yr clothes

Head down to toes a reaction to you

You say you know what he did

But you idiot kid

You don't have a clue

Sometimes they just get caught in the eye

You're pulling him through

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay

Now on the bus

Nearly touching this dirty retreat

Falling out 6th and powell a dead sweat in my teeth

Gonna walk walk walk

Four more blocks plus one in my break

Down downstairs to the man

He's gonna make it all ok

I can't beat myself

I can't beat myself

And I don't want to talk

I'm taking the cure so I can be quiet

Whenever I want

So leave me alone

You ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay

Needle in the hay"

de notas olvidadas

de rasgos de tu ausencia.

antes de soñar de nuevo

tengo que olvidarme

de tus labios

Antes, tengo que arrancar

de mi memoria

cada verso que empezaba

con tu nombre.

Quedaran algunas letras

y una errante melodía

un puñado de palabras

a medio terminar.

Cuando el tiempo

deje este camino abandonado

sin llegar a ningún lado

y desnudo de tus huellas.

Antes,

antes de soñar de nuevo

tengo que olvidarme

de tus besos.

Antes, tengo que arrancar

de mi memoria

I'm glad there is you

In this world of over-rated treasures
Of under-rated pleasures
I'm so glad there is you

I live to love
I love to live with you be, beside me
This role so new
I'll muddle through, with you to guide me

So in this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you more than ever
I'm glad there is you

I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role so new
I'll muddle through with you to guide me

Where many, many play at love
But hardly any stay in love

I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song



[Chorus:]

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love



She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down

And when I come to her when the sun goes down

Take away my trouble, take away my grief

Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief



[Chorus]



Yes I need her in the daytime

Yes I need her in the night

Yes I want to throw my arms around her

Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight



And when I'm returning from so far away

She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day

Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole

Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul

She's worth the trouble y'all
She rides me like, I like, all night, so I know
She's worth the trouble y'all
She holds me down, if it go down that's fo' sho'
She's worth the trouble
Got a playa actin' like he's a couple
I ain't never been this deep in trouble
There go my hustle
It could be bad for me
I think I'm fallin' in love

I know I ain't supposed to let her check my phone
Erase them other hoes (But I'm Gonna)
I know I ain't supposed to hit without my hat
My mommas would be mad (But I'm Gonna)

I'm going out of my way
To see her everyday
All of my niggas say (Jay why you trippin?)
But if they only knew
The things you let me do

They'd know what I'm going through

She's worth the trouble y'all
She rides me like, I like, all night, so I know
She's worth the trouble y'all
She holds me down, if it go down that's fo' sho'
She's worth the trouble
Got a playa actin' like he's a couple
I ain't never been this deep in trouble
There go my hustle
It could be bad for me
I think I'm fallin' in

Can't believe the things she got me going for
Got me like a fiend, got me beggin' her for more
Got me in the house while she running these streets
I don't give a damn, long as she come home to me
And she got a nigga open, it's hard for me to keep my focus
Like she playin' wit my mind
I can't stand a thing she do, but man I love the things she do
No matter what she put me though

She's worth the trouble y'all
She rides me like, I like, all night, so I know
She's worth the trouble y'all
She holds me down, if it go down that's fo' sho'
She's worth the trouble
Got a playa actin' like he's a couple
I ain't never been this deep in trouble
There go my hustle
It could be bad for me
I think I'm fallin' in love"

1369,Death Cab For Cutie,Someday You Will Be Loved,happy,"I once knew a girl 
in the years of my youth 
With eyes like the summer 
all beauty and truth 
in the morning I fled
left a note and it read 

Someday you will be loved 



I can not pretend 

that I felt any regret 

'Cause each broken heart 

will eventually mend 

As the blood runs red 

down the needle and thread 

Someday you will be loved 



You'll be loved, you'll be loved 

Like you never have known 

And the memories of me 

will seem more like bad dreams 

Just a series of blurs 

like I never occurred 

Someday you will be loved 



You may fell alone

when you're falling asleep 

And every time tears 

roll down you cheeks 

But I know your heart belongs

to someone you've yet to meet 

Someday you will be loved 



You'll be loved, you'll be loved 

Like you never have known 

And the memories of me

will seem more like bad dreams 

Just a series of blurs 

like I never occurred 

Someday you will be loved 



You'll be loved, you'll be loved 

Like you never have known 

And the memories of me 

will seem more like bad dreams 

Just a series of blurs 

like I never occurred 

Someday you will be loved 

Someday you will be loved"
1370,Daryle Singletary,Amen Kind Of Love,relaxed,"Don't guess I've ever loved another
Never once before did I really see the light
for they were barely friends and merely lovers
And it's taken what you've given me to feel like I do tonight
I am moved by the spirit I'm here to testify
I found an amen kind of love

The kind that makes you fall down on your knees

And reach for the sky above

The kind that your soul can never get enough

I found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love



You've given love a brand new meaning

Bound by a higher power than I've ever known before

Safe in your faithful arms I am leaning

Once I was lost but I am found for ever more and

I am moved by the spirit, I am here to testsify

I found an amen kind of love

The kind that makes you fall down on your knees

And reach for the sky above

The kind that your soul can never get enough

I found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love

We are moved by the spirit, we are here to tensify

We found an amen kind of love

The kind that makes you fall down on your knees

You say you can't take no more
She's out the door
And your looking for a friend
Who am I to tell you why

But I'm just curious, were you furious

Or did you swallow your pride

And look her in the eye and



Tell her that you love her

Tell her that you need her

Tell her that you want her to stay

Reassure her with a kiss

She may never know unless you

Show her what your feeling

Tell her you're believing

Even though it's hard to say

'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her

So open up and tell her that you love her



Brother I've been right where you are now

And my heart was broke

'Cause I never spoke

Those healing words out loud



But I've learned my lesson well

And now every night

Before I close my eyes

I look at my woman and

I ask myself did you



Tell her that you love her

Tell her that you need her

Tell her that you want her to stay

Reassure her with a kiss

She may never know unless you

Show her what your feeling

Tell her you're believing

Even though it's hard to say

'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her

So open up and tell her that you love her



Tell her that you love her

Tell her that you need her

Tell her that you want her to stay

Reassure her with a kiss

She may never know unless you

Show her what your feeling

Tell her you're believing

Even though it's hard to say

'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her

So open up and tell her that you love her

Tricked you with his letters

1374,Sinead O'Connor,War,angry,"Until the philosophy,
Which holds one race superior
And another inferior,
Is finally and permanently
Discredited and abandoned,
Everywhere is war.



Until there is no longer first class

Or second class citizens of any nation.

Until the color of a man's skin,

Is of no more significance than

The color of his eyes,

I've got to say ""war"".



That until the basic human rights,

Are equally guaranteed to all,

Without regard to race,

I'll say ""war""



Until that day the dream of lasting peace,

World-citizenship and the rule of

International morality will remain

Just a fleeting illusion to be pursued,

But never obtained.

And everywhere is war.



Until the ignoble and unhappy regime

Which holds all of us through,

Child-abuse, yeah, child-abuse yeah,

Sub-human bondage has been toppled,

Utterly destroyed,

Everywhere is war.



War in the east,

War in the west,

War up north,

War down south,

There is war,

And the rumors of war.



Until that day,

There is no continent,

Which will know peace.



Children, children.



Fight!



We find it necessary.

We know we will win.

We have confidence in the victory

Of good over evil



Fight the real enemy!"

Should have fit like a ring

Like a diamond ring

Token of true love



Should've all worked out but it didn't

She should be here now but she isn't



There's your trouble, there's your trouble

You keep seeing double with the wrong one

You can't see I love you

You can't see she doesn't

But you just keep holding on

There's your trouble



So now you're thinking 'bout

All you're missing, how

Deep you're sinking

Round and round dragging down



Why don't you cash in your chips

Why don't you call it a loss

Not such a big loss

Chalk it up to better luck



Could have been true love but it wasn't

It should all add up but it doesn't



There's your trouble, there's your trouble

You keep seeing double with the wrong one

You can't see I love you

You can't see she doesn't

But you just keep holding on

There's your trouble



Should've all worked out but it didn't

She should be here now but she isn't



There's your trouble, there's your trouble

You keep seeing double with the wrong one

When you sleep at night babaa...

I wonder do I creep into your dreams

Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy



Oh, love is so amazing

Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah...

and I'd build my house baby, with sorrow, 
I'll leave my shadow, to fall behind, 
And I woulden't Write to you, Coz I'm not that kind. 
The midnight trains are boarding, all at the ends, 

I put my lord and i filled my trunk before it's too late, 

I leave the stars to judge, while we moved, 

I'm not going to think of you or I'll get the blues. 



Theres no sleep on the journey, away from town, 

A bag of songs and a heavy heart, won't make me doubt, 

I give it all my strength and my mind, 

I'll make this decision, win all the fights, 



I'll move to Rockferry, to my road, 

And I'll build my house baby, with sorrow, 

I'll leave my shaddow, To fall behind, 

And i won't write to you, coz i'm not that kind.

el oscuro me mantiene 

cuando yo te vi 

en la lluvia me prometistes tu sangre 



Yo no me quedo en mi vida 

el oscuro me mantiene 

cuando yo te vi 

en la lluvia me prometistes tu sangre 

yo no me quedo 



Y ya que caiste de este mundo 

cargo una navaja 

dios mio

Cuantas veces me mordiste 

y cuantas veces yo me fui 



Y ya no me estoy enamorado 

con tus mentiras 

el infierno me duermo 

por que el infierno es la unica verdad 



En mi vida, 

el oscuro me mantiene 

cuando yo te vi 

en la lluvia me prometistes tu sangre 



Yo no me quedo en mi vida

At the bottom of the ocean

And when it rains

We'll get close to where the water meets the sky

But I don't mind

Dancing on the legs of a new born pony
Left right left right, keep it up son
Go ahead and have her, go ahead and leave her
You only ever had her when you were a fever

I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical
I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical

We are a fever, We are a fever

1403,Mickey Gilley,Lonely Nights,sad,"Pardon me
I don't mean to waste your time,
I just need someone to talk to
If you don't mind?
Then the thoughts of loneliness

That tonight I guess I'm to just to weak to fight,

I can take the lonely days,

But I can't take these lonely nights.



Are you alone?

Tell me what's your name?

I just need someone to lean on

I'm not playing any games.



Well, sit down here beside me

And let me buy you a glass of red rose wine

I can take the lonely days

But I can't take these lonely night.



When I thought that I was strong

But the night can be so long when you need a friend

But maybe we could find a little piece of mind

Before the morning comes again.



Oh, pardon me

If it seems I'm holdin' on

Letting go, it just isn't easy

When your sleeping all alone.



Let's forget about tomorrow

Beg, steal or borrow

hmmm. Just a little time

I can take the lonely days

But I can't take these lonely nights.



Yes, I can take the lonely days

But I can't take these lonely nights"

And that's why I've got to be yours

And I feel like I'm moving inside her
Lying in the dark
And I think that I'm beginning to know her
Let it go, I'll be there when you call

And whenever I fall at your feet

You let your tears rain down on me

Whenever I touch your slow turning pain



You're hiding from me now

There's something in the way that you're talking

The words don't sound right

But I hear them all moving inside you

Go, I'll be waiting when you call



Yeah, whenever I fall at your feet

You let your tears rain down on me

Whenever I touch your slow turning pain



The finger of blame has turned upon itself

And I'm more than willing to offer myself

Do you want my presence or need my help

Who knows where that might lead



I fall

Whenever I fall at your feet

You let you tears rain down on me

Whenever I fall (at your feet)

Whenever I fall"

I'm just ordinary people 
Who found extraordinary love
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That God keeps loving me so much

There are so many people I look up to

Used to tell them I wanna be just 

Like you

Then God took ordinary me

And gave me a chance

And everyday I gotta thank him for

Where I am



[Chorus]



I looked in the mirror, I saw average

You looked down from heaven, you saw

A gift

Still can't figure out why you

Loved me so but that's what makes 

You God

I guess I'll never know `cause

Listen to me, I can tell you how it goes

God can take a nobody

Who no one knows

Make `em more than you ever could be

Ask me how I know, he did it for me

Now we step into the fire

Beware you will pay

Leaving nothing for shame

La niña duerme tan profundo
Solo un fuego o un disparo la puede despertar
Tan inocente apenas tiene 9 años
Y mañana quizás lo entenderá
Que hubo un extraño en su cama
Tocó su cuerpecito con malicia, sin piedad
Ella no entiende que hay personas
En la vida que se animan solo para hacer maldad.

[coro]
Y ¿quién diablos fue?
Un desgraciado sin corazón
Dígame cómo entro
Quizás olvidaron cerrar la puerta
Solo saben que hizo el daño y se marcho


El dia siguiente
Un oficial preguntaba a sus padres
Cómo fue que sucedió
La madre sufre y el padre pensativo
No habia huellas de aquel que la violó
La niña llora
Se imagina que ayer mientras dormia algo malo le paso
Mas ver sangre en toda su ropa
Policias en su cuarto y un poquito de dolor.

[coro]
¿Como es posible que alguien pueda hacer daño a un angelito de Dios?
La niña solo tenia 9 anos y un malvao la violo
Aquí les traigo otra historia a la gente
Y esta vez no es de amor
No es un mensaje, es una anécdota triste

Que hoy se conviertr en canción.

[coro]

Pasaron mesess y la niña con su trauma
Se le hace dificil dormir
No se divierte
Y sus muñecas tienen polvo
Ya no juega, nadie la ve reir
Y otra noche de martirio, pesadillas del pasado
Que la hacen sufrir
Ya son las tres de la manana
Y la niña en llantos se duerme por fin.

[coro]

Y volvio el mismo desgraciado sin corazón
Pero ¿cómo de nuevo entro?

No se imaginan como lo hizo 
Nunca hubo una puerta abierta 
Ya esta vez la nina desperto

1421,Steel Train,I Feel Weird,angry,"When i was eighteen everything was alive
Then the planes hit the towers
Then she died and he died
A part of me disappeared six feet in the ground
A million miles in the sky a fire burns,
A fire burns, a fire burns and it is mine



And i did what i did

What we did to survive

Five whole years of my life i spent mourning you and why?

Girl you're still alive

But you're too dead to keep inside

You take the years, you keep it all, i finally think i might be alright



So lets just let it all go cause nothing can change

And if something is lost then there's something to frame

I just sing what i have

And i got this girl, not yet crushed by the world

Ill count the freckles on her face one, two, three hundred times a day



And sing a new song

Something i'd never here

Its BETTER LOVE that i found, bigger love that you fear

So deep inside me, hot in this frozen cave

Her fire burns, her fire burns, her fire burns and it is brave



When i was eighteen everything was alive

Then the planes hit the towers

Then she died, then he died

A part of me disappeared six feet in the ground

A million miles in the sky a fire burns,

A fire burns, and i just let it all go



I wont fear change

And if something is lost then there is something to frame

Ill just sing what i have in the heavens above

In the song in the sky a fire burns,

A fire burns, a fire burns and its for you

So firm, so firm it can calm the tide
My love for you is a mountainside
It stands so firm it can calm the tide
That's why my love, my love is a mountainside


My love, my love is an ocean roar

So strong, so strong that I can't let you go

My love for you is an ocean roar

It's grown so strong that I can't let you go

That's why my love, my love is an ocean roar



My love is longer than forever

And endless as the march of time

Till ninety-nine years after never

In my heart you'll still be mine



Because my love, my love is a deep blue sea

So deep, so deep that I'll never be free

My love for you is a deep blue sea

It's grow so strong that I'll never be free

That's why my love, my love is a deep blue sea"
1424,Linda Ronstadt,Little Girl Blue ,relaxed,"(Lorenz Hart and Richard Rodgers)
Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do
Old girl you're through
Sit there and count your little fingers

Unlucky little girl blue



Sit there and count the raindrops

Falling on you

It's time you knew

All you can count on is the raindrops

That fall on little girl blue



No use old girl

You may as well surrender

Your hope is getting slender

Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy

To cheer up little girl blue



When I was very young

The world was younger than I

As merry as a carousel

The circus tent was strung with every star in the sky

Above the ring I love so well

Now the young world has grown old

Gone are the tinsel and gold



All you can count on is the raindrops

That fall on little girl blue"

You had teardrops in your eyes

It wasn't on a Sunday (Monday and Tuesday went by)

It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon (all I could do was cry)

But I made a promise that you treasured

I made it back home to you

My little girl wouldn't say, ""I do"".

Well, I feel so sad and blue

And it's all because of you.

I could cry, I could cry, i could cry,

I could die, I could die, I could die,

Because I live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.



(Now my) covers they feel like lead and my pillow it feels like

Stone,

Well, I've tossed and turned so ev'ry night,

I'm not used to being alone!

If I could beg or borrow the money, child, I would be a highway

Bound!

This heart's on fire



It's getting better all the time

It's getting better all the time

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire



And you're my favourite thing

tell it everywhere I go

I don't know what to do

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire



Sometimes they rock and roll

I'd rather stay at home in real life

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire



It's getting better all the time

It's getting better all the time

It's getting better all the time

It's getting better all the time



This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire

This heart's on fire"

I've been loving you too long, I don't wanna stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
But my love for you is growing stronger
You see, you've become a habit to me
Ooh, I've been loving you that much too long
Please don't make me stop now
Oh, I don't wanna stop now

I dont wanna stop now, oh, I don't wanna

Oh, don't make me stop now

the same old i love you

you can change i love you

to oh such a heaveny phrase

so say it softly and gently and then

over and over again

never stop saying you're mine"
1445,Norah Jones,Shoot The Moon,sad,"The summer days are gone too soon
You shoot the moon 
And miss completely 
And now you're left to face the gloom 
The empty room that once smelled sweetly 
Of all the flowers you plucked if only 

You knew the reason 

Why you had to each be lonely 

Was it just the season? 



Now the fall is here again 

You cant begin to give in 

Its all over 



When the snows come rolling though 

You're rolling too with some new lover 

Will you think of times you've told me 

That you knew the reason 

Why we had to each be lonely 

It was just the season"
1446,Lou Rawls,You've Made Me So Very Happy,happy,"I lost at love beforeGot mad and closed the doorBut you said ""Try, just once more""I chose you for the oneNow we're having so much funYou treated me so kindI'm about to lose my mindYou've made me so very happyThe others were untrueBut when it came to loving youI'd spend my whole life with you'Cause you came and you took controlYou touched my very soulYou always showed me thatLoving you was where it's atYou've made me so very happyI'm so glad you came into my life yeahI love you so much you seeYou're even in my dreamsI can hear you, I can hear you callin' meI'm so in love with youAll I ever want to do isThank you baby, thank you babyYou've made me so very happyI'm so glad you came into my lifeYou've made me so very happyYou've made me so so very happy babyI'm so glad you cameInto my lifeI want to thank you girlEvery day of my lifeI want to thank youYou've made me so very happy (fade)"

Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamed
That you were here with me
And we were in each other's arms
It was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you
And whispered in my ear
Let's spend the night together
Sharing love beyond the bed

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share

1449,Destruction,Hate Is My Fuel,angry,"A poisoned culture - Based on lies, war & deceit
Slaughterhouse philosophy - Cruel butchers are hard to beat
The law of the game - Is the law of the bloody blade
Dictated by lunacy - It's the fail death serenade
[Bridge:]

War - As the essence of a painful life

Decay - The stream of death agony will ride



[Chorus:]

Hate - Hate is my fuel

The mob is just tool

Hate - Hate is my fuel

I'm the lord of misrule



Death brings us together as one - The feel to be second to none

Shameful should be the gluttonous - What makes a real genius?

Erases all the treasures - Wipes out all fame, affluence and wealth

Recognize the afterlife freedom - Won't be based on stealth



[Bridge:]

War - As the essence of a painful life

Decay - The stream of death agony will ride



[Chorus:]

Hate - Hate is my fuel

The mob is just tool

Hate - Hate is my fuel

I'm the lord of misrule



Insanity - We do rape, wreck and then - We search for an excuse

Decay - We all gonna rot, we're all the same on the final cruise

Modesty - Is so hard to find, is this a curse - Is this real?

Consistency - Is a gift of life, education is the deal



[Chorus:]

Hate - Hate is my fuel

The mob is just tool

Hate - Hate is my fuel

I'm the lord of misrule"

Believe in everything I read

It's such an ignorant bliss

When the whole fucking world wants to be like me

Wake up the dream is over

Touched her hips and told me that she'd let me 
I took her hand, baby this is what I said 



I said baby, baby, don't you hesitate 

'Cause I just can't wait 

Lady, won't you take me down to my knees 

You can do what you please 

Come on and love me 



I'm a man, I'm no baby 

And you're lookin' every inch a lady 

You're good lookin' and you're lookin' like you should be good 

You were distant, now you're nearer 

I can feel your face inside the mirror 

The lights are out and I can feel you, baby, with my hand 



So baby, baby, don't you hesitate 

'Cause I just can't wait 

Lady, won't you take me down to my knees 

You can do what you please 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 



Baby, baby, don't you hesitate 

'Cause I just can't wait 

Lady, won't you take me down to my knees 

You can do what you please 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me 

Come on and love me

A day that broke up your mind 
Destroyed your notion of circular time 
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway 
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway 



Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground 

For all my friends out on the burial ground 

Can't stand the feeling getting so brought down 



It's just that demon life has got me in its sway 

It's just that demon life has got me in its sway 



There must be ways to find out 

Love is the way they say is really strutting out 



Hey, hey, hey now 

One day I woke up to find 

Right in the bed next to mine 

Someone that broke me up with a corner of her smile, yeah 



It's just that demon life has got me in its sway 

It's just that demon life has got me in its sway 



It's just that demon life has got me in its sway 

It's just that demon life has got me...

i can feel this pain is real

i hate deep down inside

and like broken glass you'll shatter

with bloody fists i'll batter

like a ten ton hammer (thrown?)



i'll be the trembling in your breath

trickle of blood upon your flesh

you'd love to watch me take the fall

i'll be the thing that you despise

The man you fight, 
With all your prayers, incantations, 
Running away, a trivial day, 
Of judgement and deliverance, 
To whom was sold, this bounty soul, 

A gentile or a priest? 

Who victored over, the Seljuks, 

When the Holy Land was taken 

We will fight the heathens, 

We will fight the heathens 

We will fight the heathens, 

We will fight the heathens 

Was it the riches, of the land, 

Powers of bright darkness, 

That led the noble, to the East, 

To fight the heathens 

We will fight the heathens, 

We will fight the heathens 

We will fight the heathens, 

We will fight the heathens 

We will fight the heathens, 

We will fight the heathens 

We will fight the heathens, 

We will fight the heathens 

We must call upon our bright darkness, 

Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked, 

One was written on the sword, 

For you must enter a room to destroy it, 

International security, 

Call of the righteous man, 

Needs a reason to kill man, 

History teaches us so, 

The reason he must attain, 

Must be approved by his God, 

His child, partisan brother of war, 

Of war, we don't speak anymore, 

Of war, we don't speak anymore, 

Of war, we don't speak anymore, 

Of war, we don't speak anymore, 

We will fight the heathens, 

We will fight the heathens 

We will fight the heathens,

We will fight the heathens,

There's a hole in the wall
With a light shining in
And it's letting me know to get up
It's time to begin



Oh there is nothing to lose

'Cause it's already lost

In a runaway world

Of confusion

I'm gonna take it



(Chorus)

That's why I fight fire with fire

Oh I'm burning inside and my heart is a-cryin'

Fire with fire

I don't want to lose this flamin' desire

Standing alone

In a crowded room

I can feel a chill in the air

I'm shakin'



I'm miles away

I want to cry out loud

I want to fight till the end

I won't let 'em take me alive



(Chorus)

And you know I'll fight fire with fire

Oh I'm burning inside and my heart is a-cryin'

Fire with fire

'Cause I'm never gonna lose this flamin' desire"

Oh-oh-oh-oh
The fire, the fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Hook: John Legend]
There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul start to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes
And in tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize
I realized I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
'Cause I'm the definition of tragedy-turned-triumph
It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye-to-eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take

You might get what you're after
Cool babies
Strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house



Hold tight wait till the party's over

Hold tight were in for nasty weather

There has got to be a way

Burning down the house



Heres your ticket pack your bag: time for jumping overboard

The transportation is here

Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are

Fightin' fire with fire



All wet

Hey you might need a raincoat

Shakedown

Dreams walking in broad daylight

Three hundred sixty five degrees

Burning down the house



It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself

Gonna come in first place

People on their way to work baby what did you except

Gonna burst into flame



My house

South of the ordinary

Thats might

Don't want to hurt nobody

Some things sure can sweep me off my feet

Burning down the house



No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing yet

Everything's stuck together

I don't know what you expect starring into the TV set

Fighting fire with fire"

tengamos cada cual algo mejor

Algunas cosas de mas, 

mas dudo que encontremos nuevamente este amor



Cuantos hay que en la vida 

se pasan buscando el amor

sin nada conseguir.



Cuantos pierden dejando volar

lo que tal vez nunca ha de regresar



Por eso aunque el mundo entero en nosotros no crea

mientras exista nuestro amor

Triunfará... contra viento y marea

And I'll live in a lie
I made a fantasy world but the hero won't win this time

'Cause your pipedream gets flushed away



By all means I'm getting mad

That don't mean I don't feel sorry for you



How sad you're gonna be

I wish I could stick around

To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed

And it's all thanks to me I was wrong for coming here

You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home

Look for my face but I'm already gone



You, you never call 

You never write me or nothing

I set myself up to fall

I was stupid then to try

There was something in the way

something in the way

something in the way

that you shut the door

I couldn't get enough when you blow me off

I just kept dragging myself back for more



By all means I'm getting mad

That don't mean I don't feel sorry for you



How sad you're gonna be

I wish I could stick around

To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed

And it's all thanks to me I was wrong for coming here

You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home

Look for my face but I'm already gone



One day you're gonna see the life sentence you gave to me

But I swear one day we will share this cell

I know it's cold but I will keep us warm with all the hate I radiate

We'll be walking hand in hand in hell

(We'll be walking hand in hand in hell)



How sad you're gonna be

I wish I could stick around

To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed

And it's all thanks to me I was wrong for coming here

You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home

Look for my face but I'm already gone"

How I love all of those crazy little things you've said and done for me

Feel I've been away too long, for much too long, yeah



And all the while that I'm away, don't let our love fade away

Don't you fade away

Now as sure as the sun is gonna shine, the day will come

Now I'm waitin' for the day, there'll be no more sayin' goodbye paradise



My sweet paradise, you are the reason why it tears me up inside

And I break down and cry, didn't wanna say goodbye paradise



I'm comin' home to you tonight, comin' home to you tonight

So hold on tight, tonight I'm on my way back home to paradise



I'm so lost without you, I can't live without you

I've been away too long, now, tonight I'm on my way back home to you

War!
Do you hear revolution's call?
It's time to fight our own denial

Warmongers keep us locked in fear

Invoke the past, a moment of tears



An ugly truth

Put forth by our youth

Under the threat of patriotic brute, so



Use your rage

It is a weapon

We now must engage



Let trumpets sound our call

Or by their lies we will fall



Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing



Sing revolution's song

When they say die

Die for America



[Solo: Flynn, Demmel]



War!



They say that freedom isn't free

It's paid with the lives

Of sons and families

Cause blood is their new currency

And oil pumps the heart of money



So fight as one

Without a fucking gun

Words are the bullets to this revolution



Use your pain

The battlegrounds, the streets are ablaze



Excess will pave their path

The winds of change, our bloodbath



Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing



Sing revolution's song

When they say die

Die for America



Power and prejudice

Actions they use to pit against

Terror, insurgency

Words uses to scare conformity

It's propaganda, it's their hypocrisy

Free to choose our own slavery



All suffer humanity



[Solo: Demmel, Flynn; Demmel, Flynn]



Fight



Fight - for all that you love

Scream - choking with foot upon threat

Blind - star spangled eyes

Death - no more the truth you will hide

No, more



So how do they sleep?

When our mothers weep

They're selling our souls

And our blood for oil



Our generation

Can be the fucking one

That overcomes the greed

Of corrupt nations



Have no shame

You're not alone in thinking

This is fucking insane



Rise up and take your stand

And curl the fingers of your hand



And I don't know what to do

Cause I don't have the answers

But with ever ounce of strength

I'll vow to fight this cancer



Didn't say I want to lead

I just might let you down

Didn't say believe in me

Just hold this common ground



I'm just as lost as you

And probably more confused

So fucking far from perfect

My mind wrecked from abuse



There's something fucking wrong

When war takes sons and daughters

Our lambs misled to slaughter



War!

Clenching the fists of dissent

Lies!

Clenching the fists of dissent

Fear!

Clenching the fists of dissent

Change!

Clenching to hope

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

High above the chimney tops,

That's where you'll find me.



Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Birds fly over the rainbow

Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Why, oh why can't I?

Since I heard your lilting laughter
It's your Irish heart I'm after

Peg of my heart



Peg of my heart, oh your glances

Make my heart sing how's chances

Come be my own

Come make your home in my heart



Peg of my heart I love you

We'll never never part I love you

I always knew it would be you

Peg of my heart

Since I heard your lilting laughter

It's your Irish heart I'm after

It's your Irish heart I'm after

Peg of my heart I love you

Don't let us part I love you

I always knew it would be you

1495,Stevie Wonder,Happy Birthday,happy,"You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time

That we can set aside

To show just how much we love you

And I'm sure you would agree

It couldn't fit more perfectly

Than to have a world party on the day you came to be



Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday 



Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday



I just never understood 

How a man who died for good

Could not have a day that would

Be set aside for his recognition

Because it should never be

Just because some cannot see

The dream as clear as he

that they should make it become an illusion

And we all know everything

That he stood for time will bring

For in peace our hearts will sing

Thanks to Martin Luther King



Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday



Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday



Why has there never been a holiday

Where peace is celebrated

all throughout the world



The time is overdue

For people like me and you

Who know the way to truth

Is love and unity to all God's children

It should never be a great event

And the whole day should be spent

In full remembrance

Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people

So let us all begin

We know that love can win 

Let it out don't hold it in

Sing it loud as you can



Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday

Happy birthday

Happy birthday

Happy birthday

Ooh yeah

Happy birthday...



We know the key to unify all people

Is in the dream that you had so long ago

That lives in all of the hearts of people

That believe in unity

We'll make the dream become a reality

I know we will

Because our hearts tell us so"

We said our goodbyes (baby)

And you're no longer mine (hey)

But remember one thing (hey girl)

My love for you will never fail



Have shame on you

And have shame on me

Staying here for so long

When we both know it was so wrong baby

I want for you something better

And I hope you do stay forever

What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there



What do I do to make you want me

What have I got to do to be heard

What do I say when it's all over

And sorry seems to be the hardest word



It's sad, so sad

It's a sad, sad situation

And it's getting more and more absurd

It's sad, so sad

Why can't we talk it over

Oh it seems to me

That sorry seems to be the hardest word



What do I do to make you love me

What have I got to do to be heard

What do I do when lightning strikes me

What have I got to do

What have I got to do

When sorry seems to be the hardest word"

1501,Johnny Preston,Running Bear,relaxed,"On the bank of the river stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name, such a lovely sight to see


But their tribes fought with each other, so their love could never be







Running Bear loved Little White Dove



With a love big as the sky



Running Bear loved Little White Dove



With a love that couldn't die







He couldn't swim the raging river 'cause the river was too wide



He couldn't reach the Little White Dove waiting on the other side



In the moonlight he could see her throwing kisses 'cross the waves



Her little heart was beating faster waiting for her Indian brave







Running Bear loved Little White Dove



With a love big as the sky



Running Bear loved Little White Dove



With a love that couldn't die







Running Bear dove in the water, Little White Dove did the same



And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came



As their hands touched and their lips met, the raging river pulled them down



Now they'll always be together in their happy hunting ground







Running Bear loved Little White Dove



With a love big as the sky



Running Bear loved Little White Dove



With a love that couldn't die"

How deep can I go in the ground that I lay?

By my door

Waiting for you

Barrel organs, mothers

Down there

Just to make you mine

and hands are tied
they're leaving you
the cheap confusion
pulls through
Enter the mirror

the grays appear

discard the reel

she's making me

seem unkind (unkind)



Listen too long

so play along

one seldom viewed

policing, I'm told ""jut out""

Shooting the breeze

and see her now

confide in you

two images bound and cut (and cut)



Something angled in the dirt

You don't walk for an hour



First offense it has been shot

lost your footing

hopeless now

Covered metal on the wall

you can lend another skin

Twice now fixed on such a mess

subtle green and send it back

Precious ornament to crack

it's an overwhelming lie



First offense it has been shot

lost your footing

Covered metal on the wall

Falling in her arms and out again
Made a bed made for my game round town
Tore out my heart, and shut it down.
Nothing to do, nowhere to be.

I sip a little kind of free

Nothing to do, no one but me

That's all I need



I'm perfectly lonely

I'm perfectly lonely

I'm perfectly lonely, yeah

'Cause I don't belong to anyone

nobody belongs to me.



I see my friends around from time to time

When their ladies let them slip away

And when they ask how I'm doing with mine

This is always what I say



Nothing to do, nowehre to be

I sip a little kind of free

Nothing to do, no one to be

Isn't it hard to see



Why I'm perfectly lonely

I'm perfectly lonely

I'm perfectly lonely, yeah

'Cause I don't belong to anyone, nobody belongs to me



And this is not to say there never comes a day

I'll take my chances and start again

And when I look behind on all my younger times

I'll have to fake her arms that led me to a love so strong



I'm perfectly lonely

I'm perfectly lonely

I'm perfectly lonely, yeah

'Cause I don't belong to anyone, nobody belongs

Conquistador your stallion stands
in need of company
and like some angel's haloed brow
you reek of purity

I see your armour-plated breast

has long since lost its sheen

and in your death mask face

there are no signs which can be seen

And though I hoped for something

to find

I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador a vulture sits

upon your silver shield

and in your rusty scabbard now

the sand has taken seed

and though your jewel-encrusted blade

has not been plundered still

the sea has washed across your face

and taken of its fill

And though I hoped for something

to find

I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador there is no time

I must pay my respect

and though I came to jeer at you

I leave now with regret

and as the gloom begins to fall

I see there is no, only all

and though you came with sword held high

you did not conquer, only die

And though I hoped for something

to find

I could see no maze to unwind"
1523,Exodus,Bonded By Blood,sad,"black magic rites on this black evil night
begin with the slice of the blade
metal and blood come together as one
onlookers they gasp in dismay
taste the sweet blood of one another
sharing without any greed

bang you head as if up from the dead

intense metal is all that you need



murder in the front row

crowd begins to bang

and there's blood upon the stage

bang you head against the stage

and metal takes its price

bonded by blood



metal takes hold death starts to unfold

it's loud like the worlds at an end

your in a blood fury the metal won't stop

onlookers they bang at command

cutting your palm and drinking your blood

the power that few others dare

you feed the need to go out and kill

the same need that your blood brother shares



murder in the front row crowd begins to bang

and there's blood upon the stage

bang your head against the stage

and metal takes its price

bonded by blood"

Just another chance to see you

Just you and I

Wanted you to know

That my playing days are over

Cause all I do is think of you

The writing's on the wall



I've been out in the world

Yes, the fast life had me going



Now all that's changed

I finally make up my mind

About the one thing

I've been knowing

You're the only girl

I've ever crying for in this world

And end up going nowhere

Snake eyes in heaven - The thief

You've got to watch them - Be quick

Snake eyes in heaven - The thief

in your head...

Be quick!

Or be dead!

Be quick!

Or be dead



See... what's ruling all our lives

See... who's pulling the strings...

I bet you won't fall on your face...

Your belly will hold you in place

your ear

He says you must vote for what you

want to hear

alright

And the path was lined with sparks

Una vela alumbra mi camino

Cruzando tierras que nunca he visto

Cruzando ei rio de mi destino

Solo soy un chico mas

Que sueha en alto y mirando al mar

My path is lit by flame

Crossing lands never seen

Crossing rivers of my destiny

Only a boy nothing more

Seem like a long, long while
Sometimes the thoughts of you
Bring tears to my eyes
While the times that bring a smile

I remember what you told me

We would always be close in our hearts

Must be easy to sleep in another man's arms

We're so damn far apart



On a real lonely night

I can almost hear you laughing

Just making me a fool

I can almost see your face

On a real lonely night



There's a picture of you hanging on my wall

Such a lovely girl

Sometimes I feel like breaking into pieces

Like you did to my world



Oh, and other times I wanna hold her in my arms

Like a ball in chain

I look till I'm through loving you

I can never love again



On a real lonely night

I can almost hear you laughing

Just making me a fool

On a real lonely night

Just no way to pass the time



I walk around and I talk to myself

Pretending that it's you

I can almost see your face



I can't hold you

Like we used to do



On a real lonely night

I can almost hear you laughing

And feel your warm breath on my skin

Just making me a fool

On a real lonely night

Just no way to pass the time



I walk around and I talk to myself

Pretending that it's you, yes, I do

I can almost see your face

Down to the devils show

To be his guest forever

Hate to twist your mind

But God ain't on your side

An old acquaintance severed

Burn the world your last endeavor



Flesh is burning

You can smell it in the air

Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal



So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head

Your now a slave until the end of time here



Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare

While your nightmare comes to life



Can't wake up in sweat

Cause it ain't over yet

Still dancing with your demons

Victim of your own creation



Beyond the will to fight

Where all that's wrong is right

Where hate don't need a reason

Loathing self-assassination



You've been lied to

Just to rape you of your sight

And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel



So sedated as they medicate your brain

And while you slowly go insane they tell ya

""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

No one to call

Everybody to fear

Your tragic fate

Is looking so clear

Fight. not to fail

Not to fall

Or you'll end up like the others



Die, die again

Drenched in sin

With no respect for another



Down, feel the fire

Feel the hate

Your pain is what we desire



Lost, hit the wall

Watch you crawl

Such a replaceable liar



And I know your hear their voices

Calling from above

And I know they may seem real

These signals of love

But our life's made up of choices

Some without appeal

They took for granted your soul

And it's ours now to steal



As your nightmare comes to life



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yea

No one to call

Everybody to fear

Your tragic fate

Is looking so clear

Yeah

So give her inches

And feed her well

It breaks out loud

Till storm breaks loose

Just have to make it

1538,Papa Roach,Burn,angry,"I didn't know you were a fake
Every lie went straight to my face
So blind and I cannot see
Right behind my back you stab me
I should've known that you were a bitch
Shut up you make me sick

Little man you ain't nothing like me

Lying, cheating, so deceiving



I trusted you

You broke me down

And you screwed me over

You cannot hide it

Don't try to deny it

I've been ignited



When I get to watch you burn

Burn, burn

Now I watch you burn

Burn, burn

Now I watch you burn

Your going to get what you deserve

Now I watch you burn



You turned me inside out

My whole world is upside down

Now I know why your happy now

Looking over your shoulder

Your fucking me over



I trusted you

You sold me out

This is far from over

Don't try to deny it

You cannot hide it

I'll be ignited



When I get to watch you burn

Burn, burn

Now I watch you burn

Burn, burn

Now I watch you burn

Your going to get what you deserve

You never learn



Your time has come now

It's your turn

Now I watch you burn



Burn, burn, burn

Now I watch you burn

Burn, burn

Now I watch you burn

Your going to get what you deserve

You never learn



Your time has come now

It's your turn

Now I watch your burn

You tried to spit in the eye
Of a dead man's face
Attacked the ways of a man
Not yet in his grave

But your hate was over all too soon

Because nothing is over

And nothing's through,

Till we bury you



For the love of brother

I will sing this fucking song

Aesthetics of hate,

I hope you burn in hell



The words I read on the screen

Left me fucking sick

I felt the hatred rising

You son of a bitch

You branded us pathetic for our respect

But he made us Driven,

Such deep reverence,

Far beyond the rest



For the love of brother

I will sing these fucking words

Aesthetics of hate,

I hope you burn in hell



Yer!



[Solo: Demmel, Flynn, Demmel, Flynn, Flynn & Demmel]



Wow!

Long live memories

Live this freedom vicariously

Defend tenfold

His honor we'll always uphold



For the love of brother

I will say these fucking words

No silence against ignorance

Iconoclast, I hope you burn in hell



May the hand of god strike them down

That you lose your heart because you spend money to fulfill
That girl laughs at your sorry face

That's right, the politeness underneath the suit

Even if you don't know the answer to the simple question of C

The eyes to see the reality is far more important

I laugh at the sorry sky

That's right, the love underneath the sunny day

That's right, underneath the sunny day...



All you people looking at me, you just say what you want

You never come and reach your hand out to me

You buy love for me on my birthday

Today its cloudy and partly rain



Actuality, I want to love the world before me

Actuality I do, but



dead freedom

If you've forgotten how to scream then scream right here and live right here

I will scream as much as I want and if my voice dies, then let my voice die

If you've forgotten how to scream then scream right here and live right here

I will scream no matter how many times I die My voice will die

But I will scream right here my heart

We can dive."

Better believe it

Stand in the closet and scream with me

driven by the pain

Better believe it

down inside a grave?

Listen to the eulogy

a buyer on the hate



Ever danced beside the devil?

Taste the barrel of a gauge?

Ever pull the trigger?

The light begins to fade

Feel life slipping away

I've asked you for your grace

I've asked you for your blessing

Narrow with the hall

Swept in by discolored waste

Almost as we burn and play

Don't look so good to me

They won't grow again

Led to final peace

And this diluted stream

They don't break for them"

You can drive around all night
With the radio on high
And wonder what it's like to be liked
And never feel out of time

The dog will always bite
The serpent's underground
He lies without a sound
So let the serpent sleep
Oh let the serpent sleep

We're frozen underneath

So let the serpent sleep



The worm will eat the peach

There's pebbles on the beach

The swine is in the mud

The eagle flies above

So let the serpent sleep

Oh let the serpent sleep

We're frozen underneath

So let the serpent sleep



The ocean lives and breathes

And man creates machines

Children run away

And night turns into day

So let the serpent sleep

Let the serpent sleep

We're frozen underneath

So let the serpent sleep



Let the serpent sleep

Let the serpent sleep

We're frozen underneath

So let the serpent sleep"
1559,Andrew Bird,Simple X,angry,"some people wake up on Monday mornings
barring maelstroms and red flare warnings
with no explosions and no surprises
perform a series of exercises
hold your fire

take your place around an open fire



before your neurons declare a crisis

before your trace Serotonin rises

before you're reading your coffee grounds

and before a pundit can make a sound

and before you're reading your list of vices

perform the simplest exercises



so here at the end

the war is over

there's nothing left to defend

no cliffs of Dover

so let us put down our pens

and this concludes our test

our minds are scattered about

from hell to breakfast



hold your fire

take your place around an open fire

don't open fire"

I want you at the moment I feel blue,

I'm living ev'ry moment girl for you.



I've loved you from the moment I saw you,

You looked at me that's all you had to do,

I feel it now I hope you feel it too.

1567,Aaron Lewis,Massachusetts,relaxed,"Sit here on the stairs and listen to the nighttime as the daylight fades away
Such a haunting and familiar tune, when I hear it in the distance i can say that I'm home
Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me all alone
But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be

Because I am home



The north shore is where my father lives, I wear my red sox hat around the world with pride

But the berkshires are where my heart is and when i see them in the distance i could cry because I'm home



Massachusetts

Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me all alone

But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be

Because I'm home

Massachusetts

Where my hero teaches classes everyday and where my friends don't treat me different

It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay

Because I'm home"

To you, I'll give the world

to you, I'll never be cold

'Cause I feel that when I'm with you,

It's alright, I know it's right.

And the songbirds are singing,

Like they know the score,

And I love you, I love you, I love you,

Like never before.

And I wish you all the love in the world,

But most of all, I wish it from myself.

That it's a sin that way we live to die

You're sure to find one in the crowd

Just meet some friends and have a toke or two

In a place where they can never play the music too loud



Get ready for a party tonight

Calls her on the phone

""Can I take you out to the pictures

Joa-oa-oa-oan?""

But as she's getting ready to go

A knock comes on the door...



[Refrain] :

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer

Came down upon her head

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer

Made sure that she was dead



Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again

Teacher gets annoyed

Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away

So he waits behind

Writing 50 times ""I must not be so-o-o-oo...""

But when she turns her back on the boy

He creeps up from behind



[Refrain]



P.C. Thirty-One said ""we caught a dirty one""

Maxwell stands alone

Painting testimonial pictures ohh-oh-oh-oh

Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery

Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)

The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-oo

But as the words are leaving his lips

A noise comes from behind

(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
And I'm gonna find you
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)

[Verse 2: Howard Hewett]
They say that true love comes just once
I dreamed that when it comes
I'll really know how true love feels
And I won't let go
She'll be all mine until the end of time, forever
Hoo-hoo, ooh-ooh

[Chorus: Howard Hewett, Shalamar]
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
There's a love, hey baby
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
A love just for me
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
I'm gonna look, and look, and look
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
I know there's got to be a girl

[Bridge: Howard Hewett, Shalamar]
(Looking everywhere, trying to find someone who cares)
For me, somewhere
(Looking everywhere, trying to find someone who cares)
I can just see myself holding her close
(Looking everywhere, trying to find someone who cares)
So close
(Looking everywhere, trying to find someone who cares)
And she'll be mine, all mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Howard Hewett, Shalamar]
I know, happy, I will be
Just my girl and me
In love, I know, somewhere

[Chorus: Howard Hewett, Shalamar]
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
There's a love for me
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
And I'm gonna find it
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
She may be just around the corner
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
But I'm gonna find her
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
Somewhere
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
Somewhere
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
Somewhere
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)

And when the stars shine so bright

Who wants to be alone

You wanna be

Till the sun comes up



I am going nowhere in a hurry

Baby come take away all my worries

Oh, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you

I would've been nice to you

A little more kind to you

I would've looked twice at you

If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I probably would've shared my grub

Depending on how close we was

By now we would be so in love



Girl I'm so surprised to see

The young, fine woman that you grew up to be

Your body's banging like a 400SE

Even your attitude flows pleasantly

I remember when you was just Tonya Hall

A girl that likes to play basketball

As far as I was concern, you were one of my boys

I never cared about my sex or yours but



If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I would've been nice to you

A little more kind to you

I would've looked twice at you

If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I probably would've shared my grub

Depending on how close we was

By now we would be so in love



I'm happy to see

That you're home from school

And I wanna let you know that I'm proud of you

Even when we was younger I admired you

That's why I always used to pick fights with you

I remember when we used to call each other names

Mimic old tv shows and play those childish games

Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane

Can we do that nowadays?



If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I would've been nice to you

A little more kind to you

I would've looked twice at you

If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I probably would've shared my grub

Depending on how close we was

By now we would be so in love



[Ayana]

If I would've knew the boy next door

Would've been you

I would've been nice to you

Spent a little time with you

I would've dressed cuter too

If I would've knew the boy next door

Would've been you

I would've been on your team

When we played hide and seek

Instead of you chasing me



[Ayana (Musiq)]

You're so fly now

(Girl stop playing)

I didn't know you were that guy now

(Naw I ain't)

Phat car, phat life

Impressed I am

Oh maybe we could jam like we used to baby



If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I would've been nice to you

A little more kind to you

I would've looked twice at you

If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I probably would've shared my grub

Depending on how close we was

By now we would be so in love

If I would've knew the boy next door

Would've been you

If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

If I would've knew the boy next door

Would've been you

If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

Oh I would've spent a little more time getting to know you

Baby I would've been more gentle



If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I would've been nice to you

A little more kind to you

I know it's out of fashion
And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down

[Chorus]
From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

On a silent summer evening
The sky's alive with lights
A building in the distance
Surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach
There's not a soul around

1585,Patti LaBelle,When You Talk About Love,happy,"I'd like to give you a test,
So darlin' prepare yourself,
When I say Love please explain,
What picture pop in your brain,
'Cause when you talk about love (love, love, love),
When you think about love (love, love, love),

When you talk about love (love, love, love),

You should be talkin' 'bout me.

Now if you need to be taught,

Don't make me an after thought,

For every lesson that's wrong,

You can bet my good lovin' will be gone,

So let's erase any doubt,

Take a few seconds to figure out,

Speak from your lips to my ears,

Yes, I know you know what I wanna hear,

'Cause when you talk love (love, love, love),

When you think about love (love, love, love),

When you talk about love (love, love, love),

You should be talkin' 'bout me.

No I'm not gonna play tit for tat,

When it comes to affairs of the heart,

But if I love you I want you back,

And I know that I love you so just do your part"
1586,Mila J,No More Complaining,sad,"He done let me down again
Always hurtin me he dont neva stop 
Must be something wrong with me Im lost 
Cuz I cant quit letting him in my heart 
How many times am I gon let him apologize 
Before I realize that he aint worth it 

How many times he gon lie to me before I go 

This is critical here I go 



Damn im sick and tired of how he keep on lyin 

Damn im sick of tired of feelin like Im dyin 

So no more complaining either put up wit it or let it go 

Damn im sick and tired of making up and breaking up 

And im over being alone wen im wakin up 

So no more complaining either put up wit or let it go 



I should be packin up again 

And this time I aint playin ima call it off 

Know its not good to want revenge but its hard 

And maybe if I paid him back I could move on 

How many times am I gon let him tear me down 

Let him hang around he aint worth it no 

How many times he gon lie to me before I go 

This is critical here I go 



Damn im sick and tired of how he keep on lyin 

Damn im sick of tired of feelin like Im dyin 

So no more complaining either put up wit it or let it go 

Damn im sick and tired of making up and breaking up 

And im over being alone wen im wakin up 

So no more complaining either put up wit or let it go 



Damn I wish I knew then what I know now 

Then I would have never given you the benefit of the doubt 

I cant believe Im goin through this boy you got me like whoa 

And I know your lil secret now boy I know what youre all about 

O0o0 and o0o baby I think I done had enough 

I think its time you go away 

I just cant take it I think I done had enough

counting the leaves wich tremble in the dawn

under the leaves the swallow is resting

On to the mountain watching the Watcher

breaking the darkness, breaking the grapevine

the moment your flaw is run to your shadow

notice the shadow that reopens the vine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

heart of the sun



Breaking the shape of his questions for ever

when the sun will fall in the evening

will he remember the lesson I gave him



Set the controls for the heart of the sun

So just listen... listen...listen...



Listen to me!

Now hold out your hand

And give me

And your daybreak eyes

The whispers,

And the brand new scars

Do you forgive me?

We will never let this die

We scream our hearts out

To reject one more TIME

With love that we can share

With you I never wonder, 

Will you be there for me

With you I never wonder, 

You're the right one for me

A love to last my whole life through

I finally found the love of a lifetime

Forever in my heart

I finally found the love of a lifetime



With every kiss our love is like brand-new

And every star up in the sky was made for me and you

Still we both know that the road is long

(But) We know that we will be together

Because our love is strong



I finally found the love of a lifetime

A love to last my whole life through

I finally found the love of a lifetime

Forever in my heart

Are you gonna to be a doctor and heal?

Or go to heaven and touch God's face?

Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps?

Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps?

Or an angel under grace?

Offer up my heart and soul

The chance for revenge

In dreams of black, beyond the bounds of a withered witch's spell
Where the doors surely are locked when the sun threatens to wane
Where shamblers dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day
Liars line the roads at dawn
Watchful eyes are upon you held
Sacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell
Blood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh
Where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead
Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man
Into the tower, never go; the horrors multiply
The gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed
The rivers flow with poison
The sands swallow you whole
The ghouls that roam this darkened wood are thirsting for your throat

Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks

let's get paralysed down both sides
snake hips, red city kiss
and your black eyes roll back

yours gives into mine

it's all right

and the fast blood

hurricanes through me

and then it rips my roof away with her fire heads

this is the longest kiss

good night



oh...



and now I, I tremble,

because this fumble

has become biblical

I feel like I just died twice

was reborn again

for all our dirty sins

and the fast blood, fast blood, fast blood

I'm sorry I'm not at my best
I know you can see I'm incredibly blue
But I'm not that lonely yet
I look in your eyes while you're dancing with me

And try to fulfill your request

But don't ask for favors when it's time to leave

Cause I'm not that lonely yet



Now don't say you want me

I've heard that before

The words weigh like stones in my head

There may come a time when I'll think of you more

But I'm not that lonely yet



It's nice to be dancing

To waltzes again

And maybe it helps to forget

You've opened the door but I'm not waltzing in

To do each and every little thing

But what does it bring

Baby, you don't know what it's like

I know my frame of mind

And I'm blind, so very blind

Can't you see what I am

But what good does it do

If I ain't got you, if I ain't got you

She said there was no love in her heart,
Cause one day a rapist attacked her and broke that heart apart,
She said there was no way to fix it or to cover her scars,
Then one day a guy came along and probably could help her start,

He was sincere, made her believe it was safe for her to trust again,

Before long she was cool with giving hugs to him,

Knew that it was right, cause something was wrong,

The alarms in her mind didn't tell her he didn't belong,

There was no,

He said nobody else ever loved him,

That's why he'd get high enough to go touch the heavens above him,

Vividly remembers every pipe, every needle that stuck him,

Every alley he ever stepped in, every purse that he snuck in,

Every level of hell he's been to and the one that he's stuck in,

The one he can't escape, even though it's of his own construction,

Maybe you can relate, maybe you're one of those that just doesn't,

Maybe he doesn't care, loves to allow these demons to come in with no,

Famine striking his home, landing no social standing,

In the econmic pecking order of emergency relief distribution systems,

To float across in the boat he built, hopefully strong enough to support her,

Praying border patrols don't catch her and process and deport her,

Before she reach the shore of the land of the free, where they feed you,

Treat you like equals, decieve you, stamp you and call you illegal,

I could find in my life
There was nothing I could miss
It was easy
Easy

I had found the one before

I even knew her name

I was sure that when she left me

I would never feel the same

It was easy

Easy



What did I get myself into

I didn't realize the compromise

I put you through What did

I get myself into

And tell me how to get back into you



Now the reason for the complication's all because of me

I was sure it'd last forever

But I guess

I was naïve

It was easy

Easy



If I was the man, that I make myself to be

I would understand what understanding really means

If you could find it in your heart

To see what I'm going through

Tell me how to get back into you"

just sitting and wondering why nothing's happening
Everyone was there in a wooden chair doing nothing
Still doing nothing, drinking smoking
nothing's happening
No one seems to care in their wooden chair

doing nothing



I go walking through the park

underneath a moldy sky

Thinking ?yes I think this place

would be such a lonely place to die,

such a lonely place to die?



Nothing we're doing nothing

literally frozen stiff from nothing happening

Something has to change

cause it's no longer feeling strange

to do nothing Ad nauseam nothing

and feeling acutely every millisecond pass

We can ignore that this is sad

because we know that it all adds up to nothing



I go walking though the park

underneath the moldy sky

Thinking about all the different ways that would make lonely ways to die

all the lonely ways to die"

Haven't you been through enough?

I am the cruel one.
Don't know how I've become

A movie where the acting shows somebody you used to know.

You used to know.



Oh no.

I don't want to wake up feeling like I'm no one.

I don't want to wake up wondering how did I become the Cruel one.



It's quicker than you think.

Sadness spreads out like ink on the road and on the sea.

On the roof and balcony.



I was using loneliness and now it's using me.

There's nothing left to give to you.

One thing left to say to you.



I don't want to waste my time

standing in a waiting line,

when I know what I want, and you're just what I want.

I don't want to waste my days, worrying what they'll say.

Now I know what I want, you're just what I want."

A ""V"" of black swans

Like a thorn for the holy ones



Cold was my soul

Untold was the pain

I faced, when you left me

A rose in the rain...

So I swore to the razor

That never enchained

Would your dark nails of faith

Be pushed through my veins again



Bared on your tomb

I'm a prayer for your loneliness

And would you ever soon

Come above unto me?

For once upon a time

From the binds of your lowliness

I could always find

The right slot for your sacred key



Six feet deep is her incision

In my heart that barless prison

Discolours all with tunnel vision

Sun setter...

Sick and weak from my condition

This lust, this vampiric addiction

To her alone in full submission

None better...

Wracked with your charm

I'm circled like prey

Back in the forest

Where whispers persuade

More sugar trails

More white lady laid

Than pillars of salt



Fall to my arms

Hold their mesmeric sway

And dance out to the moon

As we did in those golden days



Christening stars

I remember the way

We were needle and spoon

Mislaid in the burning hay



Bared on your tomb

I'm a prayer for your loneliness

And would you ever soon

Come above unto me?

For once upon a time

From the bind of your lowliness

I could always find

The right slot for your sacred key

As deadly as the seven sins

You think that you're magic, but I'm no believer



And you fight like a little contender

A broken heart you can never surrender

A thousand kisses, return to sender



Your words, they come to no good intentions

You preach every word you say

Your sticks and your stones break more than my bones



You say you love me, then you hate me, then you're hot then cold

Head to toe in diamonds, you're not undersold

You think that you're magic, but I'm no believer



And you fight like a little contender

A broken heart you can never surrender

A thousand kisses, return to sender

But you got your spies telling lies

Where do you go? 

You change colors like a tiger in the snow



And you fight like a little contender

A broken heart you can never surrender

A thousand kisses, return to sender



I want to love you girl, but somehow I can't let you in

Disguised in all your makeup like the seven sins

You've got your magic, but I'm no believer

para hacer la mia

con la piel en blanco, que pide tanto

aprender



Abrazar la vida, de verdad sentirla

y saber perder, cada vez creer

que estare siempre bien



Cuando miro cada noche las estrellas

ya no pienso en lo pequeño que soy

no las nombro, ni las cuento una a una

ni las sigo porque se donde estoy



En el momento,

jugando a ser el viento

sin ataduras, no tengo dudas

de atraverme



Abrazar la vida

para hacer la mia

con la piel en blanco, que pide tanto

aprender



Abrazar la vida, de verdad sentirla

y saber perder, cada vez creer

que estare siempre bien



(En el agua sin poder nadar, o perdido en algun lugar

con ganas de querer llorar, buscando la oportunidad)



Abrazar la vida

con la piel en blanco, que pide tanto

aprender



Abrazar la vida, de verdad sentirla

He came to chase all the darkness away
If there might be things I don't understand

I'll just keep holding on to your hand

That's why you're here

Wipe away the tears of love

Oh, little boy
Asleep in my arms tonight
Under the stars so bright
King of kings
What tidings of comfort and joy he brings
Son of man
From heaven above you fell
Jehovah Emanuel
Upon a midnight clear
I feel the love

[Chorus]
It must be love
(The Father's love)
It's got to be his love
It must be his love that brought you here
Because of his love
That's why you're here
To give us hope for tomorrow
Take away the sorrow and fear (The fear)
To wipe away the tears and love (Love)

Who came to set all men free
Now all heaven and earth will sing
Behold the newborn king
It's all because of his love

Got to be his love
It could only be his love that brought you here

Feel the love of the season wherever you are

On the small country roads lined with green mistletoe

Big city streets where a thousand lights glow



Let it be Christmas everywhere

Let heavenly music fill the air

Let every heart sing let every bell ring

The story of hope and joy and peace

And let it be Christmas everywhere

Let heavenly music fill the air

Let anger and fear and hate disappear

Let there be love that lasts through the year

And let it be Christmas

Christmas everywhere



Let it be Christmas everywhere

With the gold and the silver, the green and the red

Christmas everywhere

In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds

In the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow

Elderlys' memories that never grow old



Let it be Christmas everywhere

Let heavenly music fill the air

Let every heart sing let every bell ring

The story of hope and joy and peace

And let it be Christmas everywhere

Let heavenly music fill the air

Let anger and fear and hate disappear

Let there be love that lasts through the year

And let it be Christmas

Let it be Christmas everywhere

In the songs that we sing and the gifts that we bring

Christmas everywhere

In what this day means and what we believe

From the sandy white beaches where blue water rolls

Snow covered mountains and valleys below



Let it be Christmas everywhere

Let heavenly music fill the air

Let every heart sing let every bell ring

Let anger and fear and hate disappear

There he sits all alone on the sidewalk

Hoping that you won't pass him by



Should you stop? Better not, much too busy

You're in a hurry, my how time does fly

Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky
Oh please Mr Father tree, the tallest of all

I'm so afraid and alone

Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small

Light up someone's home 'cause



One little Christmas tree can light up a home

So one little child can find a toy

One little Christmas tree can light up a home

So one little heart can find some joy



One little angel who was riding a star

Cried as she looked down at the tree

Oh please Mr Father tree wherever you are

May I give him the star you gave to me



Then in the heavens came a voice from afar

A voice that was heard throughout the world

Go down little angel girl and give him your star

Tonight he'll light the world 'cause



One little Christmas tree can light up the world

So those who are lost may find their way

One little Christmas tree can light up the world

So all men may see you on Christmas Day"

in the cemetery 

you have been left unburied 

the vultures pick at your eyes 



the cold grasp, a bloody hand 

the skeleton it cracks 

and it's twitching 

inside of your body 

the brain retreats 

the heart beats no longer 

in denial 

life no longer there 

to comfort 

to invigorate 

to betray you 

the rotten now await you 

meet the devil's keeper 

in the shadow of the reaper 

the rotten now await you 

to invade you 



the shadow of the reaper, the shadow of the dead 

entombs the lifeless 

the darkest black is cast 

the shadow of the reaper, will you take its hand

Kick your cares down the stairs

Vile is pussing, living it out

Slowly rotting and dying

The distorting of (all), (your) life

Kill all who find death is not

(To be) slowly rotting out. ??



Furthermore join me

Slowly we rot..

Is not (to be) slowly rotting out

Violently distorting

As his soul is leaking blood

Then the one will find the truth

Of slowly rotting out

We better get on right away
Well you get on your feet
And out on the street

Singing power to the people

You better give 'em what they really own
We got to put you down
When we come into town

Singing power to the people

I gotta ask you comrades and brothers
How do you treat you own woman back home
She got to be herself
So she can free herself

All my little plans and schemes,
Lost like some forgotten dreams,
Seems like all I really was doing,
Was waiting for you.



Just like little girls and boys,

Playing with their little toys,

Seems like all they really were doing,

Was waiting for love.



Don't need to be alone,

No need to be alone.

It's real love, yes, it's real love.

Oh it's real love, yes, it's real love.



From this moment on I know,

Exactly where my life will go.

Seems like all I really was doing,

Was waiting for love.



Don't need to afraid.

No need to be afraid.

It's real love, yes, it's real love.

Oh it's real love, yes, it's real love.



Caught up being in love before,

But in my heart I wanted more.

Seems like all I really was doing,

Was waiting for you.



Don't need to alone.

No need to be alone.

It's real love, yes, it's real love.

Oh it's real love, yes it's real love.

Oh real love, yes, it's real love.

Oh it's real love, yes it's real love.

Oh real love, yes, it's real love.

Oh it's real love, yes it's real love

Aujourd'hui, tu n'es même plus beau

Tu as vu midi à sa porte

Et ta force au creux de ses reins

Asphixyée et laissée pour morte,

Mais elle respire ce matin..

Empifré de ses jalousies

Tu t'es saoulé de ses méandres

De voler de ses propres ailes

Tu as su renaitre de ses cendres

Maintenant tu n'as plus besoin d'elle..

Got no sign, somebody got busted

Torn all apart, all in the name of democracy

Claimed he was a terrorist, claimed to avert a catastrophe
Someone should've told him that the buck stops here
No one ever said that he was involved with thieves

Oh, the man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone who cares
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)
Every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)
Tom, Dick, and Harry, and Suzy, too
Need love every day as much as you
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)"

Radiant beams from Thy holy face

With the dawn of redeeming grace

Shepherds quake at the sight

Glories stream from heaven afar

Heavenly hosts sing alleluia

Christ, the Saviour is born

From now on

Our troubles

Will be miles away



Here we are as in olden days

Happy golden days of yore

Who are dear to us

Gather near to us once more



Through the years

We all will be together

If the Fates allow

Hang a shining star

Upon the highest bough

And have yourself

A merry little Christmas now"

The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night

And I think to myself what a wonderful world



The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky

Also on the faces of people going by

I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do

They're only saying I love you



I see babies crying, I watch them grow

They'll learn so much more than I'll ever know

Then I think to myself what a wonderful world



The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky

Also on the faces of people going by

I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do

They're only saying I love you

We're breaking up, getting lost in the static
You're getting blurry right in front of me
The footsteps growing quiet in the hallway
As I let go, let go

The gravity that attracts us helps us implode
Or else we'd keep dividing
But I know, I know

[Chorus]
We're aimed straight at each other
We are doomed to crash
So strike up a fire, light up the town
'Cause we're aimed straight at each other
This was meant to last
So don't try to fight it, the chaos will calm us down

[Verse 2]
Our lips move but we speak in a language
That neither one of us can understand
You sleepwalk through the tape and the sirens
I let go, let go

The rules of our attraction were carved in stone
And yet you keep resisting
But I know, I know

que esto es algo que solo soñe

una promesa quedo

nos juramos lealtad sin testigos

comprometimos el alma

Taking time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store


Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?

Oh, even the man who has everything

Would be so happy if you would

Bring him love on Christmas Day

No greater gift is there than love



People you don't know smiling out hello

Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy

It's that once a year when the world's sincere

And you'd like to find a way

To show the things that words can't say



Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?

The man on the street and the couple upstairs

All need to know there's someone cares

Give love on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day

1724,Mountain,Theme From An Imaginary Western,sad,"When the wagons leave the city
For the forest and further on
Painted wagons of the morning
Dusty roads where they have gone
Sometimes traveling through the darkness
Met the summer coming home

Fallen faces by the wayside



Looked as if they might have known



Oh the sun was in their eyes

And the desert was dry

In the country town

Where the laughter sounds



Oh the dancing and the singing

Oh the music when they played

Oh the fires that they started

Oh the girls with no regret

Sometimes they found it, sometimes they kept it

Often lost it along the way

Fought each other to possess it

Often died in sight of day



Oh the sun was in their eyes

And the desert was dry

In the country town

Where the laughter sounds



Oh the sun was in their eyes

And the desert was dry

In the country town

Where the laughter sounds"

He's sittin' with a toadstool rotting in his mouth.

In a clearing where the bras hang down from the trees,

He's cappin' a coffee can full of teeth.



Down Doom's Chapel Raod, past his great grandma,

She says ""turn 'im loose, or I'll call the law.""

He says ""There's no testimony without the test,

What we do with our own is our own damn business.""

Storm punching like a hurricane
That tore him out of dreaming
Air screaming through the slightest gap

Rattling between the frame and the sill

Drapes hanging from the final act

When I had you still



One lonely bird is singing

Lower the hood hung of his lament

Dash him down on cold cement

One Bell Ringing



Flies buzzing round strip search light

They've got him down on his knees

He thinks of honey dripping from a spoon

Girls whispering in Portuguese



Between muzzle and the black site

Electrical contact

Deny your name and then carry the blame

Somewhat after the fact



One lonely bird is singing

Lower the hood hung on that last lament

Dash him down on cold cement

Whatever happened to
Saturday Night
When you dressed up sharp
And you felt all right?

It don't seem the same
Since cosmic light
Came into my life
I thought I was divine

I used to go for a ride
With a chick who'd go
And listen to the music
On the radio

A saxophone was blowin'
On a rock 'n' roll show
You climbed in the back seat
Really had a good time

[Chorus]
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

[Verse 2]
My head it used to swim
From the perfume I smelt
My hands kinda fumbled with her
White plastic belt

I'd taste her baby-pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine

Get back in front
Put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing
His very last song

With your arms around your girl
You try to sing along
You felt pretty good. Woo!
Really had a good time!

With secrets I can't keep 



Close your eyes and sleep

Don't wait up for me

Hush now don't you speak

To me



Wrapped my hurt in you

And took my shelter in that pain

The opiate of blame

Is your broken heart, your heart



So now I'm all by myself

As I've always felt

I'll betray my tears

To anyone caught in our ruse of fools



One last kiss from me...yeah

One last kiss good night



Didn't want to lose you once again

Didn't want to be your friend

Fulfilled a promise made of tin

And crawled back to you



I'm all by myself

As I've always felt

I'll betray myself

To anyone, lost, anyone but you



So let the sadness come again

On that you can depend on me, yeah

Until the bitter, bitter end of the world, yeah

When god sleeps in bliss



And I'm all by myself

As I've always felt

And I'll betray myself

Only air flying emotionless
Ring the bells for she could keep flying
This is me, completely me
End of day, we watched the sun go down

I can see you're like a firework

You want to save me, people will save me

But this is you, completely you



Now it's day, but I am dreaming

A man walks by

I want to be his wife

I'm only here sometimes

Under the tree of life

I'm only good sometimes

To keep my time to go home



Like a candle wasted from﻿ burning

I got shoes tired from walking

Calling out your name, my lips keep failing

They have now forgot to sing



Now it's day, but I am dreaming

A man walks by

I want to be his wife

I'm only here sometimes

Under the tree of life

I'm only good sometimes

To keep my time to go home

It's so relaxing to hear you're asking wherever you get your way 
I's so soothing to know that you'll sue me 
This is starting to sound the same 
I miss the comfort in being sad 


In her false withness, we hope you're still with us 

To see if they gloar or drown

She'll come back as fire, to burn all the liars, 

And leave a blanket of ash on the ground"

We're only making plans for Nigel
We only want what's best for him
We're only making plans for Nigel

Nigel just needs this helping hand



And if young Nigel says he's happy

He must be happy

He must be happy

He must be happy in his work



We're only making plans for Nigel

He has his future in a british steel

We're only making plans for Nigel

Nigel's whole future is as good as sealed



And if young Nigel says he's happy

He must be happy

He must be happy

He must be happy in his work



Nigel is not outspoken

But he likes to speak

And loves to be spoken to

Nigel is happy in his work

Nigel is happy in his work"

Your grip on me 
A hold on me 
So dull it kills 
You stifle me 
Infectious sense 

Of hopelessness and 

Prayers for rain 

I suffocate 

I breathe in dirt 

And nowhere shines 

But desolate 

And drab the hours all spent 

On killing time again 

All waiting for 

The rain 



You fracture me 

Your hands on me 

A touch so plain 

So stale it kills 

You strangle me 

Entangle me 

In hopelessness and 

Prayers for rain 

I deteriorate 

I live in dirt 

And nowhere glows 

But drearily and tired 

The hours all spent 

On killing time again 

All waiting for 

The rain"

To know you all wrong, we were
Really too late to call, so we wait for

Morning to wake you; it's all we got

To know me as hardly golden

Is to know me all wrong, we were



At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral

At every occasion once more is called a funeral

At every occasion I'm ready for the funeral

At every occasion one brillant day funeral



I'm coming up only to show you down for

I'm coming up only to show you wrong

To the outside, the dead leaves laid on the lawn

For they died and had trees to hang upon



At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral

At every occasion once more is called a funeral

At every occasion I'm ready for the funeral

At every occasion one brillant day funeral"

You I have had 22 years of
Trying to form the words that somehow
Might mean I am feeling
So many colors in this distraction

Brown hair makes her lips more red

Words would not describe what I'm seeing

I try to hold my tongue, but it's useless



She makes my heart scream color

I know by now she should have found me out

Every sense I have has been exhausted

But color makes her smile



She's always waiting for me to speak

But all she hears is whitest noise

Though I may not communicate my

Heart she knows the color I'm screaming



She makes my heart scream color

I know by now she should have found me out

Every sense I have has been exhausted

But color makes her smile



I feel it coming (x6)

I feel it coming on



She makes my heart scream color

I know by now she should have found me out

Every sense I have has been exhausted

But color makes her smile"

Cause you've filled my heart with weary old blues

Though my love wants to relieve her.

She walks alone from wall to wall.

Lost in her hall, she can't hear me.

Though I know she likes to be near me.



Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.



She sits in a corner by the door.

There must be more I can tell her.

If she really wants me to help her.

I'll do what I can to show her the way.

And maybe one day I will free her.

Though I know no one can see her.



Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa."
1771,Rush,Cold Fire,angry,"It was long after midnight 
When we got to unconditional love 
She said sure, my heart is boundless 
But don't push my limits too far 
I said if love was so transcendant 

I don't understand these boundaries 

She said just don't disappoint me -- 

You know how complex women are 

I'll be around 

If you don't let me down 

Too far 



It was just before sunrise 

When we started on traditional roles 

She said sure I'll be your partner 

But don't make too many demands 



I said if love has these conditions 

I don't understand those songs you love 

She said this is not a love song 

This isn't fantasy-land 

I'll be around 

If you don't push me down 

Too far 



DON'T GO TOO FAR -- 

The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea 

Is a cold fire 

DON'T CROSS THE LINE -- 

The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor 



Is a cold fire 

DON'T LET ME DOWN -- 

The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond 

Is a cold fire 

DON'T BREAK THE SPELL -- 

The look in your eyes as you head for the door 

Is a cold fire 



Love is blind if you are gentle 

Love can turn to a long, cold burn"

Y la sangre que brotaba, confundiose con el vino

No se apure que es que quiero con el filo de esta copa

They could be right in some crazy way

'Cause if they yell fire, well that's what we get

Yeah they yell fire, and that's what we get

So, yeah it's coming babe

But just remember: when the tide rolls in

It can't be too long until it rolls back out



And when they say that all is lost

All is not lost, all is not lost

And when they say that all is lost

All is not lost, no all is not lost at all



And if they burn

If they burn this place down to the ground

What does it matter?

Cause when they say that all is lost

In a million different ways which

Were all not quite right

Well I know

But I don't even make a sound when

I come around oh

And you say I'd be better off dead

This I know

But it's no use hiding this pretty

Head in the ground

And its love, yes its love, now its love, must be love, this is love, yes its love, now its tough, Must be love, is it love, yes its love, now its hard, must be love, and its hard, is it love, yes its not, now its hard, yet in love, is it love, this is love, must be love, it is love, love, love, no doubt



And we can do the zarathustra

We can do the broken fist

We can tear down all the borders

Or abbreviate the list

And when finally the finish line

Emerges from the mist we'll sound

A soft alarm

I don't dream of a holiday

And if I get aggression
I give it two time back

With hate and war on my back

He still comes reeling through the door

And teach you how to get to purest hell

You're gonna burn in hell

Oh, burn in hell



You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life

Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife

Well, I've played with fire, but I don't want to get myself burned

To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn

Before I burn in hell

Oh, burn in hell



Take a good look in your heart, tell me what do you see

It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?

It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate

Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late

And then you'll burn in hell



Hear no evil, don't you

See no evil, don't you (oh, burn in hell)

Lay no evil down on me (you're gonna burn in hell)

Speak no evil, don't you

Think no evil, don't you (oh, burn in hell)

1813,Exodus,The Toxic Waltz,angry,"Here's a new dance craze that's sweeping the nation
It's called the toxic waltz and it's causing devastation
You're jumping up and down like a psycho circus clown
Slamming with waltzers all the way around
You get caught up in the whip
You're thrown into a flip

You aim for someone's head

To stain the floor red

Give someone a kick

To prove you're truly sick

Bounce back from some blows

And blood runs out your nose



Flailing round and round

And you're injury bound

Waltz it up!

The pit is it!

You can take your chance

On this rough new dance

If you dare!

To dive in!

There are some that try

But they won't survive

They don't hit!

'Cause they're wimps!

And this exercise

Helps you brutalize

With us!

Exodus!



Everybody's doin' the toxic waltz

Kick your friend in the head and have a ball

Come on and do the toxic waltz

And slam your partner against the wall

Everybody's doin' the toxic waltz

Good friendly violent fun in store for all

Get up off your ass and toxic waltz

If you hit the floor you can always crawl!



Used to do the monkey, but now it's not cool

The twist and mash potato are no exception to the rule

So don't be a dunce and dance like a runt

Just throw your elbows with good friendly violent fun

Don't start to cry

If you get a black eye

Just dive back in

And give another try

But too much action

May leave you in traction

So you better get insurance

No matter your endurance!



Flailing round and round

And you're injury bound

Waltz it up!

The pit is it!

You can take your chance

On this rough new dance

If you dare!

To dive in!

Get up off your ass and toxic waltz

If you hit the floor you can always crawl!



Get up on your feet

Don't look so obsolete

And thrash like an athlete!

Don't sit there on your ass

Don't look like you've got too much class

You'll be harassed!

You know we guarantee

This is the key

So rage or get the third degree!

You begin frontal assaults

And start your somersaults

And do the toxic waltz!

Do the toxic waltz!"

You are free from the greed of your culture

You are free from the lust for the luster

There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no

I would've been nice to you

A little more kind to you

I would've looked twice at you

If I would've knew the girl next door

Would've been you

I probably would've shared my grub

Depending on how close we was

By now we would be so in love



Girl I'm so surprised to see

The young, fine woman that you grew up to be

Your body's banging like a 400SE

Even your attitude flows pleasantly

I remember when you was just Tonya Hall

A girl that likes to play basketball

As far as I was concern, you were one of my boys

I never cared about my sex or yours but

That you're home from school

And I wanna let you know that I'm proud of you

Even when we was younger I admired you

That's why I always used to pick fights with you

I remember when we used to call each other names

Mimic old tv shows and play those childish games

Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane

Can we do that nowadays?

Spent a little time with you

I would've dressed cuter too

If I would've knew the boy next door

Would've been you

I would've been on your team

When we played hide and seek

Instead of you chasing me

You're so fly now

I didn't know you were that guy now

(Naw I ain't)

Phat car, phat life

Impressed I am

Oh maybe we could jam like we used to baby

Forgive me pretty baby but I always take the long way home

Off the back of a train

Got a handful of lightning

A hat full of rain

And I know that I said

I'd never do it again

Oh and I love you sweet baby but I always take the long way home



I put food on the table

And roof overhead

But I'd trade it all tomorrow

For The highway instead

Watch your back if I should tell you

Loves the only thing I've ever known

One thing for sure sweet baby I always take the long way home



Oh I love you baby

More than the whole wide world

I'm your woman

You know you are my pearl

So let's go out, past the party lights

Where we can finally be alone

Come with me and we can take the long way home

Come with me, together we can take the long way home

Nothin' but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

When you're in love, my how they fly



Blue days, all of them gone

1840,Mitty Collier,Sharing You,happy,"Sharing you
I know I'm sharing you
I'm not the only one
Who's in your heart
When I'm with you
Your love belongs to me

But you have someone else

When we're apart



There are two of us who kiss you

Two of us who miss you

Two of us who wish there 

Were two of you



And though it hurts me so

To go on sharing you

I know my helpless heart

Just can't be free

But even though

I must keep sharing you

You know you'll

Never be sharing me"
1841,Evile,Armoured Assault,angry,"Thunder through the darkness
The curse of war has come
An armoured force invading
Serenities undone
Disciples of pure hatred
Like lightning they attack

The carry a torch of evil

The flame that burns black



Signed in blood

A pact is made

Destruction and murder has come

With blistering pace

Let battle commence

Armoured assault has begun



Cites burn in flames

Only ruins remain

Blood stains the earth

Defenders fight in vain

Crushing all before them

With metal armoured might

Futile prayers for mercy

Unanswered in the fight



Signed in blood

A pact is made

Destruction and murder has come

With blistering pace

Let battle commence

Armoured assault has begun



Locked in bitter conflict

Leg devastation begin

The iron fist of evil

Condemns you and your kin

Destruction of subhuman race

Innocents shall die

The plague of war corrupts the earth

They're fighting for a lie



Signed in blood

A pact is made

Destruction and murder has come

With blistering pace

Let battle commence

Armoured assault has begun"

Send me the pillow that you dream on
Don't you know that I still care for you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too

Each night while I'm sleeping oh so lonely

I'll share your loving dreams that once were true

Send me the pillow that you dream on

So darling I can dream on it too

But just a memory's all that's left of me

So send me the pillow that you dream on

1845,Abysmal Dawn,The Descent,sad,"As I breathe this cold that confines me
It is I who hopes to bring light to this valley of death
Behind the shadows of lies
Brilliant beams converge now to blind me
I cannot feel shame nor regret but in the presence of death
When the vultures arrive

Slaves, your time of descent will come with us all

Pain the way of all flesh that withers to old

All that you dream will be forgotten

And burn with the kindred of souls

I am the seed who was begotten

To rot with the waste of this earth down below

Now burn with the kindred of souls

Your hopes have now aged and withered away

All that you dream will be forgotten

And burn with the kindred of souls

I am the seed who was begotten

To rot with the waste of his earth down below"

I don't show much

It's not that hard to hide you see in a moment

I cant remember how to be all you wanted

I couldn't ever love you more

I couldn't love you more

I couldn't love...

You want me to cry and play my part

I want you to sigh and fall apart

We want this like everyone else

Stay if you want to

I always wait to hear you say there's a last kiss

For all the times you run this way it's not my fault

You couldn't ever love me more

You couldn't love me more

You couldn't love... 

I couldn't ever love you more

I want you to fly not stop and start

We want us like everything else

Ooo-eee-ooo...

Maybe we didn't understand

It's just the end of the world...

Ooo-eee-ooo... Ooo-eee-ooo... 

Maybe we didnt understand

Not just a boy and a girl

It's just the end of the end of the world...

Me... I don't say much

Turning away from the light

Becoming adult

Turning into myself

I wanted to bite not destroy

To feel her underneath

Turning into the light



She don't think straight

No, no, no, she don't think straight

She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops

And you don't taste like her and you never ever will

And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news

Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled



Turning away from the light

Becoming adult

Turning into myself

I wanted to bite not destroy

To feel her underneath

Turning into the light



And if you feel a little left behind

We will wait for you on the other side

And if you feel a little left behind

We will wait for you on the other side



Cos I'm on fire

Cos you know I'm on fire when you come

Cos you know I'm on fire

Cos you know I'm on fire so stomp me out

Cos I'm on fire

Cos I'm on fire

Cos I'm on fire

Cos I'm on fire"

loved him twice, i wish i'd been that passenger,
having fun fly my kite the devil inside wont
control my life
if only if only he wasen't so lonely

he'd have someone to play with instead of

bombing our neighbours

so here i go to see

the world with my eyes and with my soul, too

much love and so little hate the devil inside wont

control my fate, if only in only he wasen't so lonely

he'd have someone to play qith instead of

bombing our neighbours

hold your head and

run my time, the what of life no man can rhyme.

so here we are and here we bleed to be a

victim there's no need, having fun in ever fight

the devil inside controls my fate

if only

if only he wasen't so lonely he'd have someone to

play with instead of bombing our neighbour

I took a ride on a February morning
Just getting over it and dealing with the mourning
I started thinking out loud
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby's flying off the edge of the rope
She's saying, ""I'm so sorry about that note""
That left me all alone
But I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me what's wrong
I'd be lying if I told you
Losing you was something I could handle
Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me how long
All this darkness will surround you
'Cause I'm burning for you
Burning like a candle

That I will say these words
I remember the first time
The first of many lies
Sweep it into the corner
Or hide it under the bed

Say these things they go away

But they never do 

Something I wasn't sure of

But I was in the middle of

Something I forget now

But I've seen too little of 



The last time

You fall on me for anything you like

Your one last line

You fall on me for anything you like

And years make everything alright

You fall on me for anything you like

And I no I don't mind 



This is the last time

That I will show my face

One last tender lie

And then I'm out of this place

So tread it into the carpet

Or hide it under the stairs

Say that some things never die

Well I tried and I tried 



Something I wasn't sure of

But I was in the middle of

Something I forget now

But I've seen too little of 



The last time

You fall on me for anything you like

Your one last line

You fall on me for anything you like

And years make everything alright

You fall on me for anything you like

And I no I don't mind

Eliminate the opposite

Make enemies and friends



I am the illusionist

Satan and God

The world is my playground

And freedom is my fraud"
1860,Steel Train,Firecracker,sad,"Fire cracker!
You waved in the night
And something that I saw was flaming
Your body, it was real in the light
On the Fourth of July we were screaming

Well, I saw the lonely road

You left and said to me don't follow

Cause I'll only bring you sorrow

And on down my lonely road

You left and I just said,

""Oh no, no, no, no, no.""

All I said,

""No, no, no, no, no.""



Well I'm back in my old town again

Is there something still alive that I left Here?

You still like the boys on the street

I will take you uptown just to see you Meet them



And I saw the lonely road

You left and said to me don't follow

Cause I'll only bring you sorrow

And on down my lonely road

You left and I just said,

""Oh no, no, no, no, no.""

All I said,

""No, no, no, no, no.""



You know, I've been reading the bible For a change

Maybe there's something I have missed There

I said, I've seen, well, I've seen some Eyes in the rain

And they creep at my mind and I saw You whisper

Well, fire cracker you waved in the night

And something that I saw was flaming

Do you feel like we left something here?

Something worth coming back and Claiming?



Well, I saw the lonely road

You left and said to me don't follow

Cause I'll only bring you sorrow

And on down my lonely road

You left and said to me don't follow

You sleep and dream for tomorrow



Down in the dead of night

You left and said to me don't follow

Cause I'll only bring you sorrow

And on down my lonely road

You left and I just said,

""Oh no, no, no, no, no.""

Well, I said,

No, no, no, no, no

Arena y mar sol tropical
Y tu, tu no estas aquí

La radio esta tocando ya

Aquella canción que habla de ti

Tal vez me quede en un bar

A ver la noche llegar



San Juan sin ti

Es un espejismo desde que no estas aquí

San Juan sin ti

Ya no se que pensar

Ya no se donde ir



San Juan sin ti

Ya no es lo mismo

Te necesito junto a mi

Viven presente siempre aquí

a mi costado no es igual que estar contigo
no es que este mal, ni hablar
pero le falta madurar, es casi un niño.
Blanco como el yogur
sin ese toro que tu llevas en el pecho

fragilidad de flor

nada que ver con mi perverso favorito.

Sin tus uñas arañandome la espalda,

sin tus manos que me estrujan todo cambia,

sin tu lengua envenenado mi garganta,

sin tus dientes que torturan y endulzan yo no siento nada.

Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no,

no es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa

no destilan los poros del cuerpo

ambrosía salpicada de te quieros.

Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no,

es como no hacer nada, falta fuego en la mirada

falta dar el alma en cada beso

y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo.

Quise olvidarte con él,

quise vengar todas tus infidelidades

y me salió tan mal

que hasta me cuesta respirar su mismo aire.

Los mechones de tu pelo negro crespo,

tus caderas afiladas y escurridas,

esa barba que raspaba como lija

y tu sonrisa retorcida son lo mejor que hay en mi vida.

Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no,

no es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa

no destilan los poros del cuerpo

ambrosía salpicada de te quieros.

Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no,

es como no hacer nada, falta fuego en la mirada

falta dar el alma en cada beso

y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo.

The friends that I want 

I may need more 

But I shall just stick to those 

That I have got 



With friends I still feel 

So insecure

Little darling I believe you could 

Help me a lot 

Just take my hand 

And lead me where you will 

No conversation 

No wave goodnight 



Just make love 

With affection

Sing me another love song 

But this time 

With a little dedication 

Sing it, sing it 

You know that's what I like 

Once more with feeling 

Give me love 

Give me love 

Give me love

[Verse 1]
Those tire tracks
Zigzag your torso like a Devil's self portrait
The car accident, the skin graft treatment
The flower baskets, the wincing relatives
You bid her farewell then got in your car
And that's the last thing that you can recall
And when they pulled you out, you didn't know your name
Exploding semi truck blurred your face with flame
You met Jane four years ago today
Dancing at some vomit-stained frat party
Her newspaper gown, a fashion headline brown
Her violent gypsy dance, her tired underpants

[Chorus]
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Rhymes with pity now
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Rhymes with sympathy now

[Verse 2]
And Jane let you touch her and feel her
And she was so free like a pineapple in a tree but
You said it's dangerous to be so intimate
You know it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous
And Jane said, when she laid on her back
The sun hit her body like an ugly landscape, but
You might also like[Bridge]
Well, some things never get better
Like used cars and bad livers
So you traded her in
For a better looking brand
One with fake porno tits
A padlock on her lips
A disposable tan
Biodegradable hands
And back at the hospital
You got no visitors at all
She visits you in your sleep
That newspaper gown (That you wanted)
It’s always on fire (That you wanted)
And back at the hospital
You got no visitors at all
She visits you in your sleep
That newspaper gown (That you wanted)
It’s always on fire (That you wanted)

She met him a week after you left her
When you tossed out her touch to the garbage collector
He talked her out of her skirt in his beer-soaked apartment
And then they did all the things you never said that you wanted
The sirens are laughing underneath your skull
Your thoughts are turning dull, callous, and cold
Yesterday, you gave your burden a name
Yesterday, you gave your burden a face
Your burden, it looks an awful lot like her

Don't try

You know that we already know you

Everyday this body goes to waste

Remembering how I would raise an army when we went back to your place

Stones to pebbles, see them roll away. 
My wandering troubles need not break my back,
Mmm, sorrow is the price I pay.

I sing my sorrows to the morning; I speak them to the night.

You best believe I'll keep singing until I make my wrongs so right.

Devil said, a pity for your troubles to take your tired old soul...

So you know you got to go.



Hurry, to catch the morning.

You got to hurry on now,

In the night.

I would heed my sorrow. 

And it knows, won't be long now...

Hurry.



Now with blind hands, I crawl this lonely place,

As my dry tears fall and roll away.

I can't see troubles as they dance behind my back,

Ooo, sorrow is my soul to slay.



He stole my sorrows from the morning; he ripped them from the night.

And you best believe I'll keep singing to make my wrongs so right.

Devil took a pity of my troubles; he holds my tired old soul

So I know I got to go...



Hurry, to catch the morning.

I got to hurry on now,

In the night.

I would heed my sorrow. 

Now I know, won't be long now...

I'm the last drip standin' up against the wall
Keep fa-falling, these heels that keep me borin'
Gettin' clamped up and sittin' on the fence now
So alone all the time and I
Lock myself away, listen to me, oh no

Four-letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue
And I, I keep stallin', not keepin' it together
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Holdin' back, every day the same
Don't wanna be a loner, listen to me, oh no

But with nothing to consider, they forget my name-ame-ame-ame

That's not my name, that’s not my name

[Verse 2: Katie White]
I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standin' up against the wall
Keep fa-falling, these heels that keep me borin'
Gettin' clamped up and sittin' on the fence now
So alone all the time and I
Lock myself away, listen to me, oh no

When you're down, you go down
I hope you're getting a kick out of this, sweetheart
I hope you're gonna laugh as much as you can

Try to do them right when they do you wrong
They might be writing you this song
We've got the same spider that's creeping in
And you know the kind of rough that you're a diamond in now

Baby, it's your life, baby, it's your life
You gotta love your life, have fun with your life

When you're in the zone, when you're on the shelf
When your real ID says you are somebody else
When you're on a plane, when you're uptown
Or you're in the nude, all wrapped up in a towel

If your high heel gets caught up in your gown
And you tumble down the stairs right into a crowd
I hope you're getting a kick out of this, sweetheart
I hope you're gonna laugh as much as you can

Feeding on bones or anything grown.
I command post and nobody shows
in mornings I rest here,
in evenings I work here,
my debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left.

All I adore-



You must be the call

the evil at night

speaking words of grace

while spellwork delights.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.



I work alone saving my soul

if yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse.

Send me a sign, for my body's aligned.

I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face

my pores are wide open

and bleed for your potion,

spellwork and lies!



You must be the call

the evil at night

speaking words of grace

while spellwork delights.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

1893,Timi Yuro,Hurt,angry,"I'm so hurt to think that you lie to me
I'm hurt, way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true
And we never ever, ever part
Now you want someone new
And it breaks my heart



I'm so hurt

Much more than you ever know

Yes darling I'm so hurt

Because I still love you so

But even though you hurt me

Like nobody else would ever do

I would never ever part hurt you"
1894,Eric Benet,Hurricane,angry,"Standing here in disarray
A calm serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide
Gonna hold on

All the walls around are broken down

Now I can hear the rising sun



Surrounded by everything I want

But nothing that I need

I was blinded by the absurdity

Losing all identity

Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need

To find that road

Right around that curve a lesson learned

Now that I have the eyes to see



A hurricane, a hurricane

Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain

A hurricane, a hurricane

Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again



With poison toys I'd isolate

But the wind was strong and true

But now I see where the treause is

'Cause they only blocked my view

I'm spiraling down but so oblivious

Got to find my way home

There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me

But how do I break this shell of stone



A hurricane, a hurricane

Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain

A hurricane, a hurricane

Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again



Sometimes I cried, the tears wouldn't fall

And sometimes I tried to break those walls

And feel your love

But I came alive

When I finally found my way



A hurricane, a hurricane

Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain

A hurricane, a hurricane

Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again"

I hit the ground and run
Not sure what's coming next
And never looking back
Hollow nights to empty days

Something had to change

Before it gets too late and there's no turning back



One by one we fit and then we fall

One by one we fit and then we fall



Lonely, is this what we've become?

So lonely, fragile and unloved

Lost inside ourselves and blindly staring at the sun

So lonely, is this what we've become?



Line them up they fall

Something to live for

Not sure who's coming next

But never looking back



I want something more

Something to live for

Before it gets too late and theres no turning back



One by one we fit and then we fall

One by one we fit and then we fall



Lonely, is this what we've become?

So lonely, fragile and unloved

Lost inside ourselves and blindly staring at the sun

So lonely, is this what we've become?



One by one we fit and then we fall

One by one we fit and then we fall

So lonely, fragile and unloved

Lost inside ourselves and blindly starting at the sun

With a frozen heart
I guess we blow apart

I'll run this world out

It's running out of time

Stay in shadow

I want to watch it drown

Stay in this now



Don't say because you can't

Say what we should have been 

Don't show what I resent

Don't know cause I forget

Darkness was on my side

Now that you've come and gone

I know where I belong

Light is leaving inside of my soul"

I can't leave this, I am fine inside it

I don't feel bliss and I just keep hiding

I've been burnt so badly but I still play with fire

Sometimes naked truth is what I don't believe in

I cannot tell you you're falling apart

Open your eyes if you wanna survive

I want to tell you your love is a lie

But I won't tell you, I won't tell you



I cannot get so deep into this now

I can't admit that I know what I know and

I want to tell you your love is a lie

I won't tell you, I won't tell you



It's hard to hear through the static again

It's never clear until the rush of pain

I'll never tell you I'm living a lie

In this confusion I feel alive

I've been burnt so bad but I still play with fire

Sometimes naked truth is what I can't believe in



Don't ever tell me I'm falling apart

Don't ever tell me I will not survive

Sometimes naked truth is what I can't believe in

Don't ever tell me I will not survive

Don't ever tell me this love is a lie

No one will win the war, see families only die
And birds won't soar the sky and there'll be no sun to shine
No country wins a war, the grass won't grow the same
The moon won't shine at night and there's a losing fight

Nobody wins a war



Now what would you do, what would you say

If you heard a bomb was headed your way?

Where would you go, what would you bring

If you heard a bomb was headed your way?



Now what would you do, what would you say

If you heard a rocket was headed your way?

Where would you go, what would you bring?



No soldier wins a war, see soldiers only die

And mamas only cry just for a conscious flag to fly

That's why nobody wins a war, no war is worth your life

See that's a priceless pride, no war is worth your blood

No more death tolls with our morning coffee

Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life



It is war that you reap

But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep

The scars do not heal

Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak



Your actions are hurtful

You never find what you seek

You make the sky a storm

You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak



Your lies are your destruction, your justice stinks

Your pride is maniacal, you are the bearer of grief

Your win is shallow, your truth is oblique

Your patriotism is garbage, it rots and it reeks



Of death in the wind, the foul stench of men

Basking in their cruelty, rejoicing in their sin

You give up and give over so easily to the darker side

Because of your pride, you risk all of humanity



You send my children to murder human beings

Families they do not yet know, people they have never seen

You send my children to war

Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat

An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace



But there is always a possibility for peace

As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach

Deep, deep down in our beings

Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things



As our grandmothers say

Will soon be no more, will soon be no more

Because nobody, no one ever wins a war"

So I've learned time don't stay still and move fast

Nothing stays the same but love lasts

And I can't keep living in the past

I gotta change



Love, it will never go

Love, even when you go

It never leaves

Love never changes, love



Love, it will never go

Love, even when you go

It never leaves

Love never changes, love



Love never changes

Love won't leave

Love never changes

You have to believe when it's love

Love never changes, love



Love never changes

Love never leaves

Love is so graceful

You gotta believe when it's love

Love never changes, love



Love, it will never go

Love, even when you go

It never leaves

Love never changes, love



Love, it will never go

Love, even when you go

It never leaves

Love never changes, love"
1913,Unwritten Law,Save Me,sad,"Had a bad day, don't talk to me,
gonna ride this out,
My little black heart, breaks apart,
with your big mouth.
And I'm sick of my sickness

Don't touch me, you'll get this.

I'm useless, lazy, perverted,

and you hate me.



You can't save me,

You can't change me, 

Well I'm waiting for my wake up call, 

And everything, everything's my fault.



Went to the doctor, and I asked her,

to make this stop.(whoa)

Got medication, a new addiction,

Fucking thanks a lot.



Had to relapse, I'm outta rehab,

It ruined everything.(whoa)

So point your finger, at the singer,

He's in the pharmacy.



You can't save me,

You can't change me,

Well I'm waiting for my wake up call,

and everything's my fault.



You can't save me,

You can't blame me, 

Well I'm waiting here to take a fall,

and everything, and everything's my fault.



And I'm a death threat haven't slept yet,

Baby wide awake at dawn.

Helmet bad boy, tell the tabloids,

everything's my fault.



Whoa whoa yeah, write it write it,

Whoa whoa yeah, write it write it,

Whoa Whoa everything's my fault,

everything's my fault.



I went to heaven, couldn't get in,

For what I had done.

I said forsake me, you said you're crazy

you were too much fun.



You can't save me,

You can't change me,

Well I'm waiting for my wake up call,

and everything's my fault.



You can't save me,

You can't blame me, 

Well I'm waiting here to take a fall,

and everything, everything's my fault.



You can't save me,

You can't change me,

You can't save me,

You can't change me,(everything's my fault)

1914,Gwar,A Gathering Of Ghouls,angry,"We came from your nightmares
And we're calling for your souls
Your endless death begins today
The Bloody Pit has final say
The Bloody Pit the bloody war
The only bloody way

The Bloody Pit of Horror

It feed on endless souls

The carnage must be unimpeded

Blood and souls are what is needed

The killing goes on day and night

We'll never fill this hole

The Bloody Pit it doesn't care

About the why, the when, the where

As guts are ripped and blood is spilled

It only knows it must be filled

And that's the way its always been

Never change, never win



Let's make it clear

Just why we're here

It's for something more important

Thank for drinking all your beer

We're here to kill you

And claim your souls

And drape your stinking entrails round

Our numerous war-poles



Can't be called a crime

Happens every time

A gathering of ghouls

We fill the pit with blood and souls

This is the only rule



Zombies marching off to war

they've done it all before

A gathering of ghouls

Raping, slaying, heavily flaying



The Bloody Pit is pleased!

It's bursting with disease

A gathering of ghouls

Hacking and bashing

And selling drugs at school



They say that this world is going insane

But I care little, my zombies need brains

If we need more victims we'll load them in trains



All is as it was and will be lots more

The Bloody Pit of Horror

The bloody curse of war"

If you won't take me out

Like sawblades through the air

Your winter overture

Cut through everything, and now we're not so sure

You had twelve thousand years

And now it's all over

Five hundred billion tonnes of the purest pack ice and snow

And everything is gonna be all right

Yeah it's an angry world

Yeah it's an angry world



Some see life as hope eternal

Some see life as a business plan

Some will go to hell's inferno

For screwing up their life in freedom land

And no doubt everything will go as planned

God before bed and the promise of sleep

But it all disappears and then I wake up

Was it too late? Was it just your fate?
There's a demon that waits at the garden gate
If you get past him, maybe Lawrence and Phil
Will be waiting to take you to the ghost of rockschool

Everything hums as the blue heart turns
And the blue girl's dawn is when the sun goes down
My story tonight is from your solitude heights
I got a window on your constellation

Master I love from the ground above
As the stars below, as my memory flows
Every picture frame is beating louder than time
Every clock in the hall is bending slowly

She's in her tower and she's beautiful, sure
The quicker you learn she has no soul to discern
At least no business of yours, you bear the vacuum of scars
She was put there to tempt you like the perfume of flowers

1927,Joyce Sims,All And All,relaxed,"When you were 17 and I was 19 
We feel deep in love growin' up in Queens 
We didn't know a thing about love 
We was innocent, sneakin' on the doorstep to hug 
Held you tightly and promised you the world 
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl 

When I think about it now it makes me smile 

'Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while 

Funny how you grow up and innocence fades 

We used to live for love but now we're afraid 

{Of what?} 

Of the darkness and bitter memories 

Lovers who crushed us through infidelity 

I promised you I'll love you to the end 

Always and forever, since way back when, uh 

You're like candy, 

The world's sweetest friend 

You taste better now than you did back then 





You will always be my candy

You will always be my candy girl

While you suck caramel apple lollypops 

Rain, sleet, or snow I'm troopin' up the Murdock 

We used to walk down the block, hold hands 

I would get you after school 'cause I was your man 

And, any guys that want to socialize 

Just know that I'mma flip on any cat that tries 

My peeps used to say I was whipped 

All your girls said, ¡°Since you got with him you flipped¡± 

But, uh, they couldn't feel the feelings we felt 

Mirrors on the ceiling we melt 

I would look up at ya 

I remember the afternoon you surrendered 

We made love, 

Your temperature was high as could be 

You said, ¡°Todd, promise you ain't lyin' to me¡± 

And as we went our separate ways you turned back 

Smiled, I remember all that

I need your love 

Each and every day 





When I'm alone in my room, 

Sometimes I stare at the wall 

And in the back of my mind, 

I hear my memories call 

For days when love was true, 

I slept and held you 

Taste the brown sugar, 

Let your climax melt you 

Candy, 

You're occupyin' all of my thoughts 

Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught 

I could feel you 

Even when you're far away you're right here wit' me 

Sweet love strictly 

And I'mma bend over backwards to keep you on my side 

Take you for a mental and emotional ride 

Make love to your soul, 

Your heart, and your mind 

In your hour of need, girl, 

I'll be there every time 

And as long as you support my dreams 

Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team 

I'mma take you where the average man can only dream of 

'Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love 





You will always be my candy 

[You'll] 

One day we will start a family 

You will always be my candy girl 

[My candy girl, Candy girl] 

(You'll be my candy girl forever) 

You will always be my candy

And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view but us two

And the farmer leaves his reaping

In the meadow cows are sleeping

And the speckled trouts stop leaping upstream as we dream



A far pink cloud hangs over a hill

Unfolding like a rose

If you hold my hand and sit real still

You can hear the grass as it grows



It's a hazy afternoon

And I know a place that's quiet except for daisies running riot

And there's no one passing by it to see

Come spend this lazy afternoon with me

Come spend this lazy afternoon with me

Lazy afternoon

And I know a place that's quiet except for daisies running riot

And there's no one passing by it to see

Come spend this lazy afternoon with me, with me

And they're gonna be jealous 'cause you're so sweet

Yes, we're always in trouble

Take me home

Our hearts open as the endless sky

No more deception

No more shame

Just a reflection of the natural high

Ah, oh yeah, do you remember that song so free?



I wanna go home

Take me home

I've got to go home

Above the bones

Let us remember the memories

No more afraid

No more alone

Let our spirits fly so free

In my arms

Safe from harm, oh yeah

Ever guided by jah jah fire

Holding on to what you say
Everything will be okay it will work out one way
But i've drifted way too far my arms my legs have grown too tired
And could you be inspired now i'm just tired
And on a swing you push me hard

So i'll come back to where you are

And you know i'm never far no decisions nothing hard

And i knew that it would ring tonight i'll take the bus or the next flight

I won't give up on what feels right

If you see these tears fill in my eyes

It's just the wind that makes me cry

If you could feel this pain inside

It's from the drinks we drank last night

It's from the drinks we drank last night

The shadow of our past projects on clouds of dust and gas

The ones where my eyes will rest a silhouette of loneliness

If you see these tears fill in my eyes

It's just the wind that makes me cry

If you could feel this pain inside

It's from the drinks we drank last night

It's from the drinks we drank last night"

1942,Alkaline Trio,Time To Waste,sad,"There's someone down below blowing you a kiss.
They watch from their windows
as all arms fall to their sides,
and all eyes fix on the death of tomorrow.
And you found everything you need
to make a life complete,

completely revolting and they have safety and relief

For sale down the street.

I see you in line every day



You had time to waste and I'm not sorry,

such a basket case, hide the cutlery.

I had time to kill, it's dead and buried.

You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy.



These creatures are waking up in these dark trees.

Awaiting like vultures.

Eyes roll back turn white in time to feed

They salivate in hunger.

for you, and everything they need

to make a death complete,

completely unnatural and salvation lies

behind those dead eyes that watch you while you sleep every night, and



You had time to waste and I'm not sorry,

such a basket case, hide the cutlery.

I had time to kill, it's dead and buried.

You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy.

1949,Ray Charles,Somewhere Over The Rainbow ,relaxed,"(feat. Johnny Mathis) 
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high,
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby.

Somewhere over the rainbow

Skies are blue,

And the dreams that you dare to dream

Really do come true.



Someday I'll wish upon a star

And wake up where the clouds are far

Behind me.

Where troubles melt like lemon drops

Away above the chimney tops

That's where you'll find me.



Somewhere over the rainbow

Bluebirds fly.

Birds fly over the rainbow.

Why then, oh why can't I?



If happy little bluebirds fly

Beyond the rainbow

Why, oh why can't I?"

One come he to justify
One man to overthrow

In the name of love

What more in the name of love

In the name of love

What more your name of love



One man caught on a barbed wire fence

One man he resist

One man washed on an empty beach

One man betrayed with a kiss



In the name of love

What more in the name of love

In the name of love

What more in the name of love



Early mornin, April four

Shot rings out in the Memphis sky

Free at last

They took your life

They could not take your pride



In the name of love

In the name of love

What more in the name of love

But when I thought of all your charms

I bounced back in to your arms

You will never need to recognize yourself
To deceive
To remove all chance of doubt and be received

And decide

To reject your lives, sacrificed to me



Penance can't absolve your sin

All your belief

Cannot absolve your sin



Believe, when you lie

You will never need to recognize the source

Of deceipt

To renew your faith in God

You must believe, in your lie

The redemption is complete when you conceive

And decline

To release your lives

Sacrificed to me



Penance can't absolve your sin

All your belief

Cannot absolve your sin



Reap your life, like you want to

recognize, all you've come to



Reap your life

Veiled in shadow

Recognize

Faces of the crucified

I can hear their screams tonight

Ever haunting me



Burn your lie into me



Penance can't absolve your sin

All your belief

Cannot absolve your sin"

You've got things to do

And I have got things too

Tearing limb from limb

Cause my specs give me perfect sight

I'm not daunted by the bark of boys

I'm with the birds flying in blue skies

Feathery free and I'm feeling fine



This city is a golden gate

The kind of gold that I love to hate

How good it gets in the hype and stress

Even though it's all a well-lit mess

Bury, better plant it in the ground

True or false with the lost and found

Hurry, bury me up to my knees

I'll swing my branches better in the breeze



Mental mammoth, I know I have a very bad habit

Of filling up my cup halfway elephantisizing my eyes

Vision still untrained in seeing what i have gained

A simple remedy of walking into trees

Mistaking birds as bees

Mistaking things I see



Bury bury better plant it in the ground

True or false with the lost and found

Bury bury better plant it in the ground

True or false with the lost and found

Hurry bury me over my head

Level with the living, level with the dead

Bury bury better plant your feet down

The true and false of your lost and found"

1970,Catie Curtis,My Shirt Looks Good On You,happy,"Long nights, no sleep
Let's not turn alarm clocks on
Calls wait on my machine
Papers piling up on the front lawn
Love and happiness ruined my ambition

Love and happiness

Love and happiness, that's my condition

Love love love love and happiness



Take your time, stay for breakfast

And tell me why that tattoo

Why drive home this morning?

My shirt looks good on you



Love and happiness ruined my ambition

Love and happiness

Love and happiness, that's my condition

Love love love love and happiness



Who's the president?

I don't care

Who's the monkey, who's the mayor

What's the story

What's the news

What's the difference

All I want is you



I don't want to leave this feeling

I don't want to leave this house

I turned myself in with you and

Only you can turn me out



Love and happiness ruined my ambition

Love and happiness

Love and happiness, that's my condition

Love love love love love

Love and happiness

Love love love love love and happiness"

when you're only lonely



Now don't you ever be ashamend

when you're only lonely



when you need somebody around

on the nights that try you

and I'll be the last one there beside you

Now don't you ever be ashamed,

when you're feeling lonely and small

you need somebody there to hold you

1972,In This Moment,Beautiful Tragedy,angry,"Silent night, let me sleep away these memories within
Sacrifices of purity are turning into sins
And this judgment day is growing near
And this confession is killing me again
This beautiful tragedy is crashing into me

This dying destiny



So now you lay yourself down in this grave with shattered eyes

Beautiful melodies to try and wash away the lies

And this judgment day is growing near

And this confession is killing me again



Will you be there

Will you be there by my grave

Or will you be the death of me

My beautiful tragedy



This beautiful tragedy is crashing into me

This dying destiny, take me away

This beautiful tragedy come crashing into me 

THis dying destiny"

1976,Luis Miguel,Cruz De Olvido,sad,"Con el atardecer
Me iré de ti
Me iré sin ti
Me alejare de aqui
Con un dolor
Dentro de mi



Te juro corazón

Que no es falta de amor,

Pero es mejor así

Un día comprenderás

Que lo hice por tu bien

Que todo fue por ti.



La barca en que me iré

Lleva una cruz de olvido;

Lleva una cruz de amor

Y en esa cruz sin ti

Me moriré de hastío.



Culpable no he de ser

De que por mí puedas llorar,

Mejor sera partir

Prefiero así que hacerte mal.



Yo sé que sufriré

Mi nave cruzará un mar de soledad,

Adiós, adiós mi amor

Recuerda que te amé

Que siempre te he de amar"
1977,The Smiths,Meat Is Murder,sad,"55 ContributorsMeat Is Murder Lyrics[Intro]
*sawing machines and cow groans*

[Verse 1]
Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die?

[Verse 2]
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood
And the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour of murder
No, no, no, it is murder
No, no, no, it is murder
Oh, and who hears when animals cry?

1978,Ellie Goulding,Your Biggest Mistake,sad,"Take cover
Signs don't show
You drove me off the road
But you let go
Cos your hope is gone

And every question fades away



It's a shame you don't know what you're running from

Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off

Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start?



You know this is your biggest mistake

What a waste, what a waste, what a waste

And of all the things you never explained

You know this is your biggest mistake



You tread water

Fighting for the air in your lungs

Move

Move closer

Maybe you can right all your wrongs



But you let go

Cos your hope is gone

And every answer fades away



IT's a shame you don't know what you're running from

Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off

Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start?



Wipe the mud stains from the face stop the engine

Stop pretending

Wipe the mud spray from your face stop the engine,

Stop pretending, that you're still breathing

Running through the past to your door
I've been here before
Running to see what use I am for

Heart after heart breaks

What good am I for

How could I be so unendingly forced
into this course.
Sad

I feel sad

For you so sad

You'll be left alone and broken

Bleeding from the heart when he doesn't come home



Softly sighs my Nightingale

Another broken promise tips the scale and it goes pale

He sings

Shifting from side to side

Can't make up his God-given mind

Why don't you just go

She's waiting



Sad

I feel sad

For you so sad

You'll be left alone and broken

Bleeding from the heart when he doesn't come home



Oh honey I am telling you, you'd better think about it



Sad

I feel sad

For you so sad

You'll be left alone and broken

Bleeding from the heart when he doesn't come home"

1985,Warbringer,Total War,angry,"Thousands of soldiers march to their fate
Lambs to the slaughter, certain death awaits
Trapped on a field littered with bones
Nations of falling lying below
Now you march forwards- to die

Ten million bodies piled high

Mechanized engines of war spitting lead

Horrors of battle fill you with dread

Bombs are falling, death is calling

Fire raining from the sky

Blown to bits by a hail of lead

Fall without a reason why

Call upon gods of death

Fight! Awaken all your rage

Launch the attack, no turning back

Charge! Your destiny awaits

The order is given, over the top

Scream, for you it is too late



We'll give you what you've been waiting for-

TOTAL WAR

Not ready to die, though your time will come tonight"

on the eye of a flea on a bears back



take your earplugs out

hear what the birds have to say

they've been trying

they've been trying

and the birds tire today



and they're waiting around for the wind

sick of waiting around for a win



up at the lookout point

and down in make out creek

love is lying

in the sun

and oh thank god for sleep



and they're waiting around for a sign

sick of waiting around for a sign

So swallowed and followed and played through start to end
With the good weight all carried by your faithful friend



She wrote you a song and you bought a wedding dress

Having handsome bite buxom

Have insured people met

Then sundry and nocturnal

You lay your peace to sleep

With your new loves good fortunes

And secrets safe to keep

Can tether no more

What's shrunken withers

In the path to your door

There aint no easy way no there aint no easy way out 

Its easy to fall in love when you fall in love you know your done"
1994,Neil Young,Only Love Can Break Your Heart,happy,"When you were young
and on your own
How did it feel
to be alone?
I was always thinking
of games that I was playing.

Trying to make

the best of my time.



But only love

can break your heart

Try to be sure

right from the start

Yes only love

can break your heart

What if your world

should fall apart?



I have a friend

I've never seen

He hides his head

inside a dream

Someone should call him

and see if he can come out.

Try to lose

the down that he's found.



But only love

can break your heart

Try to be sure

right from the start

Yes only love

can break your heart

What if your world

should fall apart?



I have a friend

I've never seen

He hides his head

inside a dream

Yes, only love

can break your heart

Yes, only love

can break your heart"
1995,ABC,Poison Arrow,angry,"If I were to say to you
""Can you keep a secret?""
Would you know just what to do
Or where to keep it?
Then I say ""I love you,""
And the foul situation

""Hey girl, I thought we were

The right combination.""



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target,

Blame Cupid, Cupid

You think you're smart

Stupid, Stupid



CHORUS:

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart

Shoot that poison arrow

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart

Shoot that poison arrow



No rhythm in cymbals

No tempo in drums

Love on arrival

She comes when she comes

Right on the target

But wide of the mark

What I thought was fire

Was only the spark



The sweetest melody is an unheard refrain

So lower your sights

Yeah but raise your aim

Raise you aim



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target,

Blame Cupid, Cupid

You think you're smart

Stupid, Stupid.



CHORUS



""I thought you loved me but it seems you don't care.""

""I care enough to know I can never love you.""



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target

Blame Cupid

You think you're smart

That's stupid

Right from the start

When you knew we would part



CHORUS



Shoot that poison arrow"

In and out Up and down

If your love is a ship

I pull your anchor and I Christen it



I'm in love with love

(I'm in love)

And it broke me in two

(in two)

I'm in love with love

Look out baby, It's gonna break you too



I'd pull your ship across the ocean wide

Hold my breath

And dive dive dive

If they held me at the bottom

Then asked me why

I'd open my mouth and I'd tell em why 'cause



I'm in love with love

(I'm in love)

And it broke me in two

(in two)

I'm in love with love

So look out baby, It's gonna break you too



We're huddled up on benches

We're saying our prayers

Two lovers in the mist

With the salt in their hair



I'm in love I'm in love



And it broke me in two

I'm in love I'm in love

It's gonna break you too

Yes it will



The waves are breaking in a foreign tongue

Understand but I'm feeling numb.

If your love was a ship

I'd pull your anchor and hang on to it



I'm in love with love

(I'm in love)

And it broke me in two

(in two)

I'm in love with love

So look out baby

It's gonna break you too



I'm in love with love

(I'm in love)

And it broke me in two

I'm in love with love

So look out baby

It's gonna break you too

1999,Bloodsimple,Falling Backwards,angry,"(featuring Chad Gray) 
I'll show no allegiance 
All shall feel my wrath 
Ten years of discontent never given a change 
But love is passion 

May my love be vengeance 

And this love I shall forsake 

And on this day I slit my wrist 

And do away with everything 



Fuck it 

Cut up 

Bleeding 

Beaten 

Cheated 



I'm tired of falling backwards 

I'm tired of all the deceit 



Fuck all of the people driven by the greed 

They will all be dealt with accordingly 

Just let them be 



Fuck it 

Cut up 

Bleeding 

Beaten 

Cheated 



I'm tired of falling backwards 

I'm tired of all the deceit 



I'm tired of falling backwards 

I'm tired of people trying to take a piece 



Wage war on the bastards 

Wage was on the street 

Wage was all around you 

Wage was on the weak"

Something's just not right
Just this morning you cried about last night
You said that something's bound to break this time
What's breaking is my heart

I can read between the lines

It's tearing me apart

You've got leaving on your mind



but you're My Angel baby

yes you're My Angel baby

Wooh you're My Angel baby

for the rest of the night



Do you remember how it used to be?

loving was easier when you were loving me

i guess you found someone and now I find



What's breaking is my heart

You've got leaving on your mind"

2006,ZZ Top,Arrested For Driving While Blind,sad,"When you're driving down the highway at night
And you're feelin' that wild turkey's bite
Don't give Johnny Walker a ride
Cause Jack Black is right by your side
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find
You've been arrested for driving while blind



Now just the other night with nothin' to do

We broke a case of proof 102

And started itchin' for that wonderful feel

Of rollin' in an automobile

You could say we was out of our mind

And let me tell you we were flyin' while blind



Then they had us up against the wall 

Hey it's only blood grain alcohol

And there ain't no cause for alarm

We ain't out to do nobody no harm

How could anyone be so unkind

To arrest a man for drivin' while blind"
2007,Fear Factory,Self Bias Resistor,angry,"Hey you! Wake up!
Open your swollen eyes
Erosion invades you mind
A cancer that grows over time
Hey you! Rise up!

Rise to fight, eliminate

Burn your fuse to detonate

The human machines of hate



[Chorus:]

All these years they've tried to break you

To your knees

Anger scours right through your veins



Now it's time to put an end

To all the lies

Now it's time to take control

Of your life



Wake up! Rise up!

Open minds will dominate

Burn your fuse to detonate

The human machines of hate

Hypocrisy

You can't believe

Machines of hate

A disease that infiltrates



Persist for resisance

Resist their insolence

You are a dissident

Burn away conformity [X2]

Lift your cotton socks on

And turn your cameras on now for the fun

While I light a fire in your new shoes

Let's hope that your soles don't burn to the floor



I light the fire

We make an ornament with gold and silver plating

So what's the latest we raise a fever

We're just all red inside that's all to see here



Yeah we're red inside we're all red inside

And the leg bones connected to the one in the thigh

We're red inside we're all red inside

With one love

From the beginning

A child is born to a world that lies waiting

To prove our father's love for all mankind

2016,Jose Luis Perales,El Amor,sad,"El amor, es una gota de agua en un cristal,
es un paseo largo sin hablar,
es una fruta para dos.
El amor, es un espacio donde no hay lugar
para otra cosa que no sea amar,

es algo entre tu y yo.



El amor, es llorar cuando nos dice adios,

el amor es soñar oyendo una canción,

el amor es rezar poniendo el corazón,

es perdonarme tu y comprenderte yo.



El amor, es parar el tiempo en un reloj,

es buscar un lugar donde escuchar tu voz,

el amor es crear un mundo entre los dos,

es perdonarme tu y comprenderte yo



El amor, es una boca con sabor a miel,

es una lluvia en el atardecer,

es un paraguas para dos.



El amor, es un espacio donde no hay lugar,

para otra cosa que no sea amar,

es algo entre tu y yo."

Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone 
But watch it break when I get you alone 
Take a chance, come lay down with me 
Oh, I wanna make it 



Slow and steady never lost the race 

Don't stop runnin', I'm a fool for the chase 

Play the game, surrender to me 

Baby, I don't wanna fake it 



Is it any wonder, you got me comin' under fire? 

Comin' like thunder, you know you make me walk the wire 



It's so easy to put on a show 

Your body says yes but you won't let it go 

But my passion it won't slip away 



You got me, I'm cornered, my back to the wall 

No bed of roses, ain't no bed at all 

I'm walkin' the wire, I stumble and fall 

I got the message but I ain't gonna crawl"
2018,Alicia Keys,That's How Strong My Love Is,happy,"Some people they call me crazy
for falling in love with you
well they can take me 
and lock me away baby
'cause there's nothing 
those bars can do



I'll be the rising moon 

after the setting sun

just to let you know 

you'll always have someone

I'll be the clearest day

when the rain is done

so you'll always know



through the shake of an earthquake

i will never fall

that's how strong my love is

like a ship through the storm

we can risk it all

that's how strong my love is



I used to feel kinda lonely

cause the world it can be so fake

and all that matters i'm telling you

is you and me only

and the fortress from love we'd make



I'll be the water you need 

in the desert land

just to let you know 

you'll always have my hand

i'll be the woman you need 

to be a better man

so you'll always know



through the shake of an earthquake

i will never fall

that's how strong my love is

like a ship through the storm

we can risk it all

that's how strong my love is



oh, can't nothing break us down

oh, 'cause we are heaven bound

like the mountain standing tall:

immovable; we're here to stay

oh, can't nothing get in the way



through the shake of an earthquake

i will never fall (i will never fall)

that's how strong my love is

(that's how strong my love is)

like a ship through the storm

we can risk it all (we can risk it all)

that's how strong my love is

(that love is)



through the deepest waters

i won't let you drown 

(I won't let you drown Ohh!)

that's how strong my love is 

(Oh that's how strong my love, 

my love, my love)

cause we're the moon in the sky

that will never come down 

(never come down)

that's how strong my love is 

(Oh that's how strong my love is)

that's how strong my love is

that's how strong my love is

Beneath my Christmas tree

Has gone away from me

Oh, my Christmas tree is not very big
In fact it's kind of small
Honey went, he picked 'em out
They always seem so tall

The lights don't seem so bright this year
It's hard for me to see
The smile that made my Christmas bright
Is gone away from me

I have been so lonely
Since you left me all alone
All I want for Christmas is
My baby back at home

My room's so big and cold

Él acabó la tarea primero que todos nosotros
Éramos nosotros cuatro y con él, cinco locos
Cuantas noches llorando cantamos, que noches aquellas
Hasta hicimos llorar a la luna contandole penas

Pero en el camino
Donde pasamos los últimos años de nuestra vida
Un día se marcho sin decirnos adiós
Juguetón como siempre, se marchó simplemente
En el polvo de un rayo de sol que atardecía

Yo le quisiera mandar a decir
Que si las almas cantan canciones
Que si en el cielo tienen guitarras
Para cantarles a los amores
Y si Él me manda a decir que sí
Que nos separe cuatro lugares
Porque algún día, ¿cuándo?, no sé
Volveremos a ser cuatro locos y él, otra vez cinco

So, tell me Christmas
Are we wise to believe in things we never see?
Are prayers just wishes in disguise?
And are these wishes being granted me?
For now I see
The answering
To every prayer I've prayed
She's coming home this Christmas Day

[Verse 2]
So tell me Christmas
Are we kind more this day than any other day?
Or is it only in our minds?
And must it leave when you have gone away?
It's different now
It's changed somehow
And now you're here to stay
She's coming home this Christmas Day

[Verse 3]
All at once the world
It doesn't seem the same
And in a single night
You know it all has changed
And everything is now as it should be
I have the ornament
I have the perfect tree
I have a string of lights
I have a chance to see
Everything that my heart thought could be
You might also like[Verse 4]
For of all the dreams
You were the first I knew
And every other one
Was a charade of you
You stayed close when I was far away
In the darkest night
You always were the star
You always took us in
No matter who we are
And so she's coming home this Christmas Day

How many people are asking for love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day

Find your way

Cause holidays have come and gone

But love lives on

If you give on

How could you wait another minute

A bug is warmer when you're in it

And Baby that's a fact

And saying ""I love you's"" always better

Seasons, reasons, they don't matter

So don't hold back

How many people in this world

So needful in this world

How many people are praying for love



Don't save it all for Christmas Day

To give a little love everyday

Don't save it all for Christmas Day

Everywhere that they go

Their whole life long

Let them know love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day

And must I refrain

Now that I need you

The autumn wind feels

As if it were you

And swayed through the fields

Where I once held you



It seems you lost your way

You've let it all fall apart

Nothing's left here but you

All you do is remind me

Now that we've lost out way

The rest can all fall apart

All I see here is you

All it does is remind me



Whistle through your window

We act the same as you



Whistle through your window

We act the same as you"

Covenant of pure corruption
Sink my teeth deep into you
Solemn oath of sheer destruction

Hope is swallowed up in pain
Taste the venom, feel the power
Coursing through my veins

Everything I did was wrong
And I found fault
In everyone but me

I was hurt and alone
I could not find my way home
Broke-down and hungry
And too tired to moan

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
A world of confusion

We move on and never let out

The things we had whispered about



Back to the mirror now

There's nobody left to defend

Get out if only I could

The most beautiful thing you can ever spend 
But you work in a shirt with your nametag on it 
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

It's all I wanted to be 

It's a million miles from here 

Somewhere more familiar 



Too much time spent dragging the past up 

I didn't see you not looking when I messed up 

Settling down in your early twenties 

Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

The only thing growing is on this story 

Knock me down I'll get right back up again 

It comes back stronger than a powered up Pac-Man

Bury your face in my shoulder

The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis

The daffydils who entertain

At Angelo's and Maxi's



When a Broadway baby says good night

It's early in the morning

Manhattan babies don't sleep tight

Until the dawn



Good night, baby

Good night, the milkman's on his way

Sleep tight, baby

Sleep tight, let's call it a day

Hey!



The band begins to go to town

And everyone goes crazy

You rock-a-bye your baby round

'Til everything gets hazy

Hush-a-bye, I'll buy you this and that

You hear a daddy saying

And baby goes home to her flat

To sleep all day



Good night, baby

Good night, the milkman's on his way

Sleep tight, baby

Sleep tight, let's call it a day

did you take a chance and lose it all 

do you fear there's no collateral left for trying 



Friend I know your heart is raw 

But love is still a worthy cause 

Picking up and pressing on 

Oh love is still a worthy cause 

It's the touch that starts the thaw 

Love is still a worthy cause 

or the word that breaks the pause 

Love 



It's the beauty in the tales we tell 

It's the pushing through and ending well 

and finding strength to give ourselves away 



in the midst of passing bravery 

in the face of our own injury 

It's the constant generosity of grace 



Friend I know your heart is raw 

But love is still a worthy cause 

Picking up and pressing on 

Oh love is still a worthy cause

And I found out with time

That really I was not ready, no, no

Decimate those dear to me

Teased me with your sweet release

She fought but then succumbed to it

But you made her beg for it

Everything im taught, amounts to nought

Everything I learn, the fire shall burn

Notions of myself that i'm not

Who ever I was is now lost



Illumination, illumination

Burn burn, burn brightly

Burn burn, burn white heat



Oh how ingenious the centuries of lies

Ezekiel's chariots streak across the skies

Holy books and history texts forget

Because we know

Souls are recycled in the death and resurrection show



O beloved mother of liberty

Come to me



Burn away all my impurities

Hold me in your arms



Burn burn, burn brightly

Burn burn, burn white heat"

Blow it all away

I could take all those lies you said to me 

Never go away 

Never dissappear

Attacking once more now with twice as much strength

We conquer then move on ahead

Guides us with every first step

Our axes are growing with power and fury

Soon there'll be nothingness left

Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on

We clash with God's angel and conquer new souls

Consuming all that we can

Y entre el calor y entre los mosquitos habló de Cristo
El padre no funcionaba en el Vaticano
Entre papeles y sueños de aire acondicionado
Y fue a un pueblito, en medio e' la nada
A dar su sermón, cada semana, pa' los que busquen la salvación

El niño Andrés Eloy Pérez tiene 10 años
Y estudia en la elementaria ""Simón Bolívar""
Todavía no sabe decir el Credo correctamente
Le gusta el río, jugar al fútbol y estar ausente
Le han dado el puesto en la Iglesia de monaguillo
A ver si la conexión compone al chiquillo
Y su familia está muy orgullosa, porque a su vez se cree que
Con Dios conectando a uno, conecta a diez
Suenan la campanas, un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés
Suenan la campanas, un, dos, tres

Sabe por experiencia que no es la solución

You need to prove, prove your worth 

To ascend to the trial of champions 

Every fight a battle to the death 

Your fate lies in the hands of fools 

A meagre wager more precious than your life 

When the thumb comes down 

You know just what to do 

Kill kill kill 

It's your time do what must be done 

Every day you fight, every day you win 

Taking the life of the emperor 

The ultimate reward for surviving the trial 

You will not die in chains, a champion you are"

We crush the weak, displace the sick for who? For you
Turn around and die, you're denied forsaken at the gates
Turn around and die, you're denied forsaken at the gates

Forsaken at the gates!



Arise dissipate, abort subjugate run through

Enforce constrain, displace the blame, on you

Now face your fate, we shut the door on you, on you



Turn around and die, you're denied forsaken at the gates

Turn around and die, you're denied forsaken at the gates

Forsaken at the gates!

They never doubt the beauty that awaits inside
Like a flower reaching out, reaching for the sun
They don't compare theirselves to anyone
And I wonder why we do


So don't try too hard now, be who you are now

You've got to let it shine

Beauty has no face, no color, no race child

Beauty is inside



In your eyes, I see your light

Shining from your heart when you don't even try

So just be yourself 'cause there's no one else

No one else like you, there ain't nobody in this world it's true

So let your light come through



So don't try too hard now, be who you are now

You've got to let it shine

Beauty has no face, no color, no race child

Beauty is inside

Beauty is inside



There's more than what meets the eye

Much more than on the outside

It's something that's deep inside

You won't find it on a movie screen or pages of a magazine

Much more than the eye can see



Don't try too hard now, be who you are now

You've got to let it shine

Beauty has no face, no color, no race child

Beauty is inside



Don't try too hard now, be who you are now

You've got to let it shine

Beauty has no face, no color, no race child

I don't know
I cannot see
Who we are now
How we used to be



Is it you?

Or is it we?

Look in the mirror

We are a fading memory



Where are we?

We got lost

In the cold



I will live again you'll see - tomorrow's not scaring me

Far away from yesterday - just take this pain away



Fatal chaos

Hurtful lies

A broken dream

Is all we left behind



Is it you?

Or is it we?

Look in the mirror

Just a fading memory

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence

I will call her name out loud.

I would bleed for her.

If only I could see her now.

Balancing on a ledge.

Living on a razors edge.



The evil that men do lives on and on....[4 times]



Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems. 

The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.

And I will pray for you.

Kind woman

Don't leave me lonely tonight

Please say it's all right



Remember once before you're hearing

The old folks say

Love's an ageless old rhyme

But now a days you know the sayin' depends so much on

The kind of woman that you find

sentir la boca del miedo. (oasis de amor) 

Tú y yo, Arena y escorpión, en un mar de fuego.

bajo el beso de la noche.



Rodando por el mundo camino, camino

pregunto a la quimera el enigma del destino

nómada, loco, noctámbulo y soñador,

un vagabundo. (Eeeeeeeeeeeee)

lenguas de sol, beber a tragos el placer (pero se van ya)

Tú y yo, arena y escorpión, en un mar de fuego,

buscando la quimera, bajo el beso de la noche,

lenguas de sol, oasis de amor, poetas en el Edén.

Al fin, te encuentro en esta hoguera

beso al fuego y no me quemo.



Rodando por el mundo camino camino,

pregunto a la quimera el enigma del destino

And on that sweet and velvet night
A child had died, a woman had been born

But you don't see me anymore

So back to my room I go with a gloom

And I cry tears of goodbye

A sad and a long, lonely day

I walk the avenue hoping that I'll run into

Like the wind you let 'em in now they'll never leave.
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun where the dead lay

Run from the gun don't be afraid

Run from the gun...

Dried my mouth took me out and left me glad

You did me no favors

It was dumb and the last one that I ever had

Run from the gun don't be afraid

Run from the gun where the dead lay

Run from the gun don't be afraid

Run from the gun...

It was loaded with the pressure

Too much pressure to be measured

I was holding off the wrong and the right...

I got let down gently

Never even knew the end was on the way

Then I made my peace there

Opened eyes and my surprise it was a waste

Run from the gun don't be afraid

Run from the gun where the dead lay

Run from the gun don't be afraid

Run from the gun.."

Wider, brighter

I get to pine I get to cry
Being without you
You think my world is tumbling down

You know the reason I can't hurt
I got a heart of stone

I went away to meet my love
I saw things that I can't have
It makes me mad
To think of you with someone else

You know the reason I can't hurt

Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train, heave on to Euston

[Chorus]
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
Ohh

[Verse 2]
You've left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?

[Chorus]
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

[Verse 3]
You've left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that ""When he goes, he really goes""

Dirty rotten scoundrel, that's what I'm called, on the street
Could connive and cheat but rarely get beat
Ya see I'm streetwise, a con-game pro
Kickin the Bobby bullshit, too smart for Willie Bobo

Not stressin five-o, hot hand in celo

Live in the land of crooks yes Brooklyn's the borough

Homicide central, East New York

Where the manic, depressive psycho murderers stalk

Walk, like a ninja, on the asphalt

Here talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk

And there's more hardtimes, than on Good Times

And most niggaz dedicate their life to crime

So I'm steady schemin, won't work for a dime

Used to get, tax free loot, all the time

Type slick can't fess on 'Ru, because



[Verse Two:]



Before trains were graffiti proof I used to get loose

Dirty rotten since the days of the deuce

Dirty, because of the skin I'm in

The fact I have melanin automatically makes me a felon

Even though I'm righteous, rotten's what you're yellin

But I'm not chain-snatchin, or drug-sellin

According to your books you said I would be damned like Ham

Scoundrel opposite of the king that I am

But wanna get funny, we can get bummy

Take you to the East and back again money

Filthy putrified trick, step past your sister

Challenge the Damaja, and you'll be history

Mortal Kombat fatality, the original don't sing no R&B

Nasty MC deity

Chop off domes with the poems that come out of my pin-eal

gland, as I expand, you know who I am



[Verse Three:]



Father of all stylin, I be whylin on wax

We hack shit up like big ax and little ax

Don't need tokes to make you jump like bungee

Tracks real muddy, like Brooklyn's real grungy

When I come through I clog up your sewer

Peep the maneuveur, drop the ill manure

So bring Mr. Clean, Drano, and Roto Rooter

No matter what you do, you can't get through the

Crud that comes out of your system

You're another victim, of dirty rotten

Dirt up, in your grill, so what ya gonna do

But pay homage to..."

Stars can't fight city lights
They've turned their backs on us
It's true today, I saw it from the plane
Aeroplanes were never built to fly



Down down down down...

Don't look down

Don't look now



Crosshairs of our shadow trace the dam

Told that there were people trapped alive

Boulder City looks like coals in the fire



Cabin's perched by satellites

And now it's flying down

We've got a lady pilot

She's not afraid to die



It's true today, I saw it from the plane

We've almost finished reeling in the sky

Power lines once laced the heavens

So don't let the moment pass you by

I don't believe there is a greater love, one [?] and pain

And the love between a momma and her children



And the procession down to the light house

We hear the crashing of the waves and the mistakes we made

You know that we are not the only ones so we can have some fun

Have some, have some, have some, have some fun

Though we pretend there's much more to capture

These are sacred days

Let's make room for each other

And let love have its way

Have your fill of its wonder

But never hold on too, too tight

And you might, you might win

Hey yay ayy, hmm

You might win

2164,Los Horoscopos De Durango,Ahora Que No Estas,sad,"Te dije tantas cosas sin pensarlo
sé que hablé de más
que sin querer te herí
y te alejé de mí
No tuve el valor de enfrentarlo

el orgullo pudo más

dije que sí

Podía vivir sin ti



Ahora que no estás

me duele tanto aceptar

que el corazón ya no late igual

y todo me parece nada

porque me faltas



Ahora que no estás

no sé por dónde caminar

para escapar de esta soledad

regresa en mi vida no hay calma

porque me faltas



Los celos me nublaron la mirada

y la duda pudo más que nuestro amor

no sé cómo pasó



Qué puedo hacer

para que al fin regreses

para que tu vuelvas a confiar en mí

yo te necesito aquí



Ahora que no estás

me duele tanto aceptar

que el corazón ya no late igual

y todo me parece nada

porque me faltas



Ahora que no estás

no sé por dónde caminar

para escapar de esta soledad

regresa en mi vida no hay calma

porque me faltas



Dame sólo una señal

tú entiendes lo que yo te digo

no te quise lastimar... jamás



Ahora que no estás

me duele tanto aceptar

que el corazón ya no late igual

You know you blew me away

Will you care for me

Will you comfort me

Will you be the one

The one who's gonna rescue me

I am so glad you came in time

Now that your here

I just adore you baby

Into a void

We filled with death

A noise that laughs

Falls off thier maps

All cured of pain

And doubts in your

Little brain



Something's coming, sky is purple

Dogs are hounding to themselves

Days are changing with the weather

Like a riptide come rip us away



I push, I pull

Into a void

We filled with death

A noise that laughs

Falls off thier maps

All cured of pain

I'm changing my ways

are breaking bread with their benevolent hosts

and a foreign enemy to deplore

declining crime 



we've got to kill 'em in the end 

before they reach for their checks 

squeeze some blue collars 

let them bleed from their necks 

seize a few dollars from the people who sweat 

cause it's freedom or death and they won't question it 

at a job site the boss is god like 

conditioned workhorses park at a stoplight 

seasoned vets with their feet in nets 

a stones throw away from a rock fight 

but not tonight, feed 'em death 



here comes another ration (feed them death) 

cause they're the finest in the nation (feed them death) 

but there's nothing left to feed them 

when it's freedom or it's death

To show the things that words can't say

All need to know that there's one cares 

Give love on Christmas Day

Don't say I'm waterin religion down
I'm just including people all around
Isn't that what the whole deals about
Don't wanna leave nobody out
I don't care what you believe
On Hanukkah or Christmas Eve
Ramaddan and Kwanzaa too
I'm just trying to be nice to you

It's all colliding
What's a guy to do
Don't wanna go and offend anybody
Are they Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or Jew
You can't tell by looking
And it don't feel right to guess
Buyakasha, frickin kumbaya
It's all the same
God Bless
And I say

It's been a long time since I did the Stroll.
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back,
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from.
It's been a long time, been a long time,
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

Yes it has.

It's been a long time since the book of love,

I can't count the tears of a life with no love.

Carry me back, carry me back,

Carry me back, baby, where I come from.

It's been a long time, been a long time,

Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

Aaaaaaaah aaaaaaaah



Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight,

Making vows that just can't work right.

Open your arms, opens your arms,

Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in.

It's been a long time, been a long time,

Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

Yeaaaaah hey

2201,Melissa Etheridge,Christmas In America,relaxed,"I picked out a tree
And I tied it to the car
There's a wreath up on our door
Eight tiny reindeer in the yard
I drove under the downtown lights
Red and green and blue

The silver neon snowflakes

Only made me think of you

It's Christmas all around me

You're in someone else's land

So I'm sending out my only wish

Hey Santa tell the man



Hey mister send my baby home

This December I don't want to be all alone

Oh Christmas in America

I need you in my arms

Far away from harm

Mister send my baby home



I hear someone singing jingle bells

No wait that deck the halls

And the teenagers with candy canes

Ramble through the malls

The girls are down at Ruby's

Trying to find some Christmas cheer

There's not much to do but drink too much

When everyday's unclear

So here I am on Christmas eve

This silent holy night

And I reach up to the stars for you

And I pray that you're alright



What happened to the peace on earth

All that goodwill toward men

Oh come on all ye faithful

It's time to think again"

Another two bit politician peddling lies
Another three ring circus society
What this world needs is not another sign waving super saint that's better than you
Another ear pleasing candy man afraid of the truth 
Another prophet in an Armani suit



What this world needs is a Savior who will rescue

A Spirit who will lead

A Father who will love them in their time of need

A Savior who will rescue

A Spirit who will lead

A Father who will love

That's what this world needs



What this world needs is for us to care more about the inside than the outside

Have we become so blind that we can't see

God's gotta change her heart before He changes her shirt

What this world needs is for us to stop hiding behind our relevance

Blending in so well that people can't see the difference

And it's the difference that sets the world free



Jesus is our Savior, that's what this world needs

Father's arms around you, that's what this world needs

That's what this world needs"

There's a smile on my face

He's brought all the presents

Put them right in their place

He's probably flyin' high

Across the moon

He'll be at your chimney

Any time soon



So light up the fire

Walk through the snow

Come and stand with me now

Time on your side that will never end
The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

It don't matter to me

'Cos all I wanted to be

Was a million miles from here

Somewhere more familiar

Too much time spent dragging the past up

I didn't see you not looking when I messed up

Settling down in your early twenties

Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

It don't matter to me

'Cos all I wanted to be

Is a million miles from here

Somewhere more familiar

Oh my god I can't believe it

I've never been this far away from home

And oh my god I can't believe it

I've never been this far away from home

And oh my god I can't believe it

I've never been this far away from home

And oh my god I can't believe it

I've never been this far away from home

Great rulers make for greater glory

The only thing growing is our history

Knock me down I'll get right back up again

I'll come back stronger than a powered up Pac-Man

It don't matter to me

'Cos all I wanted to be

Was a million miles from here

Somewhere more familiar

Oh my god, I can't believe it

I've never been this far away from home

And oh my god I can't believe it

I've never been this far away from home

And oh my god I can't believe it

I've never been this far away from home

2214,Gotan Project,Peligro,sad,"No deberían engañar
Pero caen en la tentación
Un torbellino
De locura, de ardor y deseo
Si aumenta el peligro

Aumenta la excitación

La lluvia golpea

El techo de la habitación



Tiene tanto que perder

Sin embargo no pueden parar

Tesón primitivo

Lazo de fuego



Tan real el peligro

Irracional atracción

La lluvia golpea

El techo de la habitación



Y después

Que ya no se verán nunca más

Pero el misterio

Los arrastra al placer sin remedio



Aumenta el peligro

Crece la satisfacción

La lluvia golpea y golpea

El techo de la habitación

Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

From now on our troubles will be far away



Here we are in the olden days

Happy golden days of yore

Faithful friends who are dear to us

Gather near to us once more



Through the years we will all be together

If the fates allow

Hang a shining star upon the highest bough



And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

And have yourself a merry little Christmas now"

The ringing in your ears
I'm down on the ground
My luck's been dry for years
I'm lost in the dark

And I feel like a dinosaur

Broken face and broken hands

I'm a broken man



I've hit the wall

I'm about to fall

But I'm closing in on it

I feel so weak

On a losing streak

Watch my taillights fade to black



I read a thing about this girl

She was a hermit in her world

Her story was much like mine

She could be my valentine



And although we've never met

I won't forget her yet

She cut herself off from her past

Now she's alone at last



I feel so sick

Lost love's last licks

But I'm closing down on it

I feel so weak

On a losing streak

Watch my taillights fade to black



Lost my life in cheap wine

Now it's quiet time

Cappy Dick nor Jesus Christ

Could not help my fate



But I'm underneath a gun

I'm singing about my past

Had myself a wonderful thing

But I could not make it last



I've hit the wall

I'm about to fall

But I'm closing in on it

I feel so small

Underneath it all

Watch my taillights fade to black

..Watch my taillights fade

..Watch my taillights fade

..Watch my taillights fade"

I pound the walls I shake the cage 

I will not fall

It fills me with desire 

And it drives me and drives my cause 

I'm filled with reasons, but reason drive me further

Turned into something more
The pain I felt inside my head
Came on my day of birth
Now the time has come for me
To burn the planet Earth

I can feel the fire burn inside of me

Burn, ignite the population
Burn, causing mass cremation
Burn, feel no shame or pity
Burn, apocalyptic city

Years have passed as I stood still
To plan the final blow
I'll make the town go up in flames

Would you do it for me 'cause I'm feeling lonely?

Praying, hoping, and I leave the door wide open
I see you when you cast your spell
But come and sit by me 'cause I'm feeling lonely

Maybe I'm a stupid fool
Chasing butterflies like you
On these days, they seem so cruel
But honey child, what can I do?

Maybe I'm a stupid fool
Chasing butterflies like you

And I gaze into the rising sun
Like every day to day you're on my mind
And even though I am far I know where you are

And I know it won't be very long

I'll be on my way, coming home



I smell your perfume on the breeze

As a hint of jasmine's calling me

While the trees are whispering your name

And all the things that they do remind me of you



And I know it won't be very long

I'll be on my way coming home

Going home, sweet home

And you pray on high our souls to keep

Then cast your dreams to the stars above

And when you awake, I'll gently touch your face



All your lonely moments will be gone

When I'm all alone, I am home

Stiff as a stick on a board

Piled in the corner

Bring that beer over here

Just to make a sound

And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange

A little anxious when it's dark



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have constant fear that something's

always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's

always there



Have you run your fingers down

the wall

And have you felt your neck skin crawl

When you're searching for the light?

Sometimes when you're scared

to take a look

At the corner of the room

You've sensed that something's

watching you



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have constant fear that something's

always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's

always there



Have you ever been alone at night

Thought you heard footsteps behind

And turned around and no one's there?

And as you quicken up your pace

You find it hard to look again

Because you're sure there's

someone there 



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have constant fear that something's

always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's

always there



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Debating witches and folklores

The unknown troubles on your mind

Maybe your mind is playing tricks

You sense, and suddenly eyes fix

On dancing shadows from behind



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have constant fear that something's

always near

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

I have a phobia that someone's

always there



Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

And all the time I never thought I'd say

It's a soul connection, you're changin' my world

Give me your affection, be my girl

It's a real love, it's a real love

It's a real love, it's a real love



The thing about you so far, you squeeze my peaches

You send me postcards of girls on beaches

You're drinking in a bar in Amsterdam

I'm thinking baby far out, be my man

It's a real love, it's a real love

It's a real love, it's a real love

It's a real love, it's a real love

Standing up behind an electric guitar

2271,Joe Jackson,The Uptown Train,sad,"If I stop  and think about it
I'm either stone cold certain
Or more inclined to doubt it
But when you jump into the darkness
Well I take off my hat

You've changed

They say 

You can know when to play or to hold

And they think they can show all that glitters is gold

And they don't care to go where you go 'cause they know you're insane

When you change

To the Uptown Train



Well I knew  that you were trouble

You were a ten time loser

Or maybe even double

But you pulled some kind of rabbit

From your hippie hat



You've changed

They say 

Take it slow when you're breaking the mold

Got to pay what you owe or be out in the cold

And they don't care to know what you know or to go through the pain

To change

To the Uptown Train"

Cuando este tendido q toque la banda,

q traigan cartones llenos de cerveza

y echenme la tierra q me vio nacer

yo quiero invitarlos q mi funeral

antes q la muerte me venga a buscar

yo quiero invitarlos a mi funeral

no quiero q nadie me vaya a faltar.



Cuando yo me muera q toque la banda

esa del recodo q tanto cante,

quiero de los tigres el jefe de jefes,

y q los mariachis

me canten el rey.

a mi funeral pa q brinden x mi

quiero ver a todas aquellas mujeres q

me hicieron daño y me hicieron feliz

Cuando este tendido q se oiga la banda."

Blacktop letters written all in chalk, 
So that she might see me,
When school is over, 
Dripping thoughts all onto your sidewalk, 

I couldn't tell you,

Cryptic message written in the dark, 

How it haunts me, 

As she laid closer, 

Locking hands floating through the park,

They'd always watch me, 

Losing composure"

I've passed this way before. I've felt this pain before. A hurt that took so long to end. Has found my poor heart again. As I watch love walking away. It brings back old memories. But a familiar pain still feels the same. Once again, heartache has found me. A dark cloud covered my heart. Oh, when she told me goodbye. Now there's nothing left but emptiness. And the tears that filled my crying eyes. I've passed this way before. I've felt this pain before. A hurt that took so long to end. Has found my poor heart again. No matter how strong a man is. Without a love he walks in the dark, baby. If love deserts him it would surely hurt him. 'Cause his weakness is his heart. A lonely journey now stands before me. The endless pain has started. But this time I know the way. Walking alone and broken hearted. Because I've passed this way before. And I've felt this pain before. A hurt that took so long to end. Has found my poor heart again.

2294,Skeletonwitch,Where The Light Has Failed,angry,"Seek out the darkness, welcome wretchedness
Submerged in hatred, blasphemy, and death
Desire the fire, become evil's flame
Allegiance to the unlord, kill and kill again
Within the darkness, all is consumed
Inclined to madness, chaos, and doom

Overflowing evil, bound by wickedness

With unholy eyes of the serpent, void of righteousness

Dead is the world I live in, evil is the air I breath

Where the light has failed, darkness now prevails"

over the border he will drown in light
hold it -- wait a minute
I can't read my writing, my own writing!
like tiny insects in the palm of history
a domino effect in a cloud of mystery

my writing is an iron fist

in a glove full of vaseline

but dip the fuse in the kerosene

I too become a dissident



Courting disaster we ran in the night

wings of an angel torn in flight

check it -- verify it

it's all here in writing, down in writing!

at the hands of the press

and in the eyes of the government

I fell from grace

I too became a dissident

like tiny insects in the palm of history

a domino effect and an early end to this story

my writing is an iron fist

in a glove full of vaseline

but dip the fuse in the kerosene

I too become a dissident"

2314,The Shirelles,Will You Love Me Tomorrow,happy,"Tonight you're mine completely
You give you love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?
Is this a lasting treasure

Or just a moment's pleasure?

Can I believe the magic of your sighs?

Will you still love me tomorrow?



Tonight with words unspoken

You say that I'm the only one

But will my heart be broken

When the night meets the morning sun?



I'd like to know that your love

Is love I can be sure of

So tell me now, and I won't ask again

Will you still love me tomorrow?



So tell me now, and I won't ask again

Will you still love me tomorrow?

Will you still love me tomorrow?

Will you still love me tomorrow?"
2315,The Beatles,In My Life,happy,"There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall

Some are dead and some are living

In my life I've loved them all



But of all these friends and lovers

There is no one compares with you

And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life I love you more



Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life I love you more x2"

And when you try and run I'll be the curse above you

That's what I've learned

say what I wanna say, say what I wanna say



Know that I want you



The sky in my mind is always blue

In my world the sun shines from you



Often I know I don't see

The waves of love that wash over me

Your love is a paradigm

For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme

Visualizing paradise is a

thing I don't wanna do, a thing I don't wanna do



But I know that I want you



The sky in my mind is always blue

In my world the sun shines from you



Life traces the line in space between

What's gone and what's gonna be

Time chases me, my mind races

To find the place where I wanna be



The sky in my mind is always blue

In my world the sun shines from you

Under fire we were without defense

A long range cruiser, it was our only chance, oh yeah 

We could see no way out but one 

There was no choice but to try and run

Everywhere is somewhere

And nowhere is near

Everybody got somebody

With their wine and their beer

So I'm just this tragic figure

In the corner over here

With an empty apartment

And a best friend who is queer



Everytime I see him he smiles

And he tells me how well he's walking these miles

But he never ever asks a single thing about me

If I die, he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses,

I need Moses

To cross this sea of loneliness,

Part this red river of pain



Everywhere is somewhere

And nowhere is near

Everybody got somebody

With their wine and their beer

So I'm just this tragic figure

In the corner over here

Go home to an empty apartment

And call a best friend who is a queer



Diamonds, roses,

I need Moses

To cross this sea of loneliness,

Part this red river of pain

To cross this sea of loneliness,

Part this red river of pain

To cross this sea of loneliness,

Part this red river of pain"

All good, all bad, ALL UGLY
They were like brothers 'cause we all felt the same
The future tore them away
Born with our senses keen - HOPE AND FEAR

With a sense of danger and demise

The world will numb everything - HOPE AND FEAR

A negative discipline, a vacuum



What evil force dragged them down?

What demon singled them out?

What evil took them away?

Allowing only two choices



So tell me 

Was there a secret never shared with others?

Was there a hidden trauma?

What made the bonds break?

What caused the mistakes?

Why was the criminal life so desired?



Born with our senses keen - HOPE AND FEAR

With a sense of danger and demise

The world will numb everything - HOPE AND FEAR

A negative discipline, a vacuum



From afar bleak reports trickle in, but 

The world has spread apart, the world has spread apart

All the promise that was held now is wasted

The soul is delicate, the walls have crippled it

From afar troubled lives lose their purpose

The world has given up, the world has given up

The world has finally forsaken its sons



What evil force dragged them down?

What demon singled them out?

What evil took them away?

Allowing only the choice between

DEATH OR JAIL"

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight

The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made

Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 



They said it was for science

But I'm the human guinea pig

The guinea pig

The guinea pig

The guinea pig

The guinea pig

The guinea pig



My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes

The nightmare continues, I see through their lies

The papers keep turning, the tests never ends

Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration



They said it was for science

But I feel like the human guinea pig



Time may have passed on, but I won't soon forget

The old sensation, pure frustration of a human guinea, guinea pig"

Til suddenly we found that the brakes were gone
Oh you belong to someone else and I do too
It's just crazy bein' here with you

Like a bad motorcycyle with the devil in the seat



Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

I did not want to want you but now I have no choice

To late to listen to that whining voice

All I hear is thunder when two hearts beat



Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street



Oh you're not free to belong to me

And you know that I could never be your own

But your lips on mine

Oh, the sweet, sweet wine

What are we going to do



Warning signs are flashing everywhere we pay no heed

Instead of slowing down the pace we're picking up speed

Disaster's getting closer everytime we meet



Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

Than see this wound

That we have created

Lets not last the night

I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy

Senseless and I'm not sure why

I'm not going to pretend that I know all the answers

Or all of the questions

Its got to be good for something

So we'll chalk this and we'll mount the dead

On the fireplace above right above our guilded heads

And boring me with your body

How many times can I say I'm sorry

In my mind, a celebration
The sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
In my imagination
There is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true

[Chorus]
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love

[Verse 2]
It's a crazy situation
You always keep me waiting
Because it's only make believe
And I would come a-running
To give you all my loving
If one day, you would notice me

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is close to breaking
And I can't go on faking
The fantasy that you'll be mine
I'm dreaming
That you're in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true

[Chorus]
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love

I should be so lucky (So lucky, so lucky)
I should be so lucky
I, I, (I, I)
I should be so lucky (So lucky, so lucky)
I should be so lucky

There is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true

I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky

You are the river
Pour out of this life
How could you

Fly away



You are the blood of me

The harvest of my dreams

There's nowhere I can find peace

And the silence won't cease



Nothing quite how it seems

The ghost of my joy

Won't let me be



If you set me free I will not run

I will not run

I will not run

And there's a body in the lake

As the spiders kiss is laid

The tumor becomes malign

Goes out to all my players out there, man

You know, that got that one good girl, dog

That's always been there, man, like, 

Took all the bullshit

Then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave



Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night

And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side

Could've sworn I was dreamin'

For her I was fiendin'

So I had to take a little ride

Backtracking on these few years

Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad

Where you would get up and run

The night sets softly
With the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawl

[Verse 2]
Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me

[Verse 3]
From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should
For in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin
Or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns
That can scarcely be controlled1Embed

Time's were tough, but kind of bittersweet
Left school when I was still a child
Hit the streets and started running wild

Hanging out in the neighborhood

People said they're up to no good

Never thought I'd ever make it through

Hey boy, what you gonna do?



Crosstown traffic, sirens wailing, screaming in my ear

It's got me on the run, gotta move on out of here



I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street

Well, it's got me beat, on a dead end street

I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me?

From this dead end street, oh yeah



They still talk about the big fight

On the backstreet at midnight

Everybody heard the gunfire

Saw him dragged into the Black Maria



Now, my best friend is doing time

He's committed to a life of crime

Got a feeling, I'll be next in line

I wonder how can I get out in time?



I stepped into a movie, this can't be reality

If I wasn't so lucky, I wonder where I'd be?



I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street

Well, it's got me beat, on a dead end street

I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me?

He only had one favourite toy.
And he had thing on his mind,
And never left anything behind.
No.

As he got older, things got worse,

Like he'd been born under a curse.

Things started to fall apart,

They weren't like they were at the start.

No, it's like a civil war.



Growing up,

It's like a civil war.

Don't turn away,

It's something you can't ignore.

Growing up,

It's like a civil war.



And now that he was in his teens,

He'd started to learn what life means.

Problems were still appearing,

They didn't look like disappearing.

I'm so serious but that's not it

You're plain boring and you bore me asleep



But it's classical anyways

How cool are you I remember

And I feel sickened

And who the fuck are you anyway you suck

And hop off the train for a second

Change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fucking lazy



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!

And I smell like shit



Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving

I sure as hell can't do it by myself

I'm feeling like a DOG IN HEAT

Barred indoors from the summer street

I locked the door to MY OWN CELL

And I lost the key



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!

And I smell like shit



I GOT NO MOTIVATION

WHERE IS MY MOTIVATION

NO TIME FOR THE MOTIVATION

SMOKING MY INSPIRATION



Sit around and watch the phone,but no one's calling

Call me pathetic,call me WHAT YOU WILL

My mother says to get a job

But she don't like the one SHE'S got

When mastur bation's lost its fun

You're fucking lazy



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn BORED

I'm going blind

And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes

I was slipping away to paradise

Some say,""Quit or I'll go BLIND.""

But it's just a myth"

Getting out of control

So I sit up late in the morning

And ask myself again

How do they kill children?

And why do I want to die?

They can no longer move

I can no longer be still 



I hate

My way"

I got high...

(What did you feel there?)

Well, I cried...

(But why the tears then?)

Tell you why...



It's all too beautiful! [x4]



I'll tell you what I'll do.

(What will you do?)

I'd like to go there now with you,

you can miss out school.

Why go to hear the words of fools?

(What did you do there?)

I got high...

(What did you touch there?)

I touched the sky...

(But why the tears then?)

I'll tell you why...



It's all too beautiful! [x4]



I feel inclined to blow my mind,

get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun.

They all come out to groove about

be nice and have fun in the sun.

""Can you keep a secret?""

And the foul situation

""Hey girl, I thought we were

The right combination.""



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target,

Blame Cupid, Cupid

You think you're smart

Stupid, Stupid



CHORUS:

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart

Shoot that poison arrow

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart

Shoot that poison arrow



No rhythm in cymbals

No tempo in drums

Love on arrival

She comes when she comes

Right on the target

But wide of the mark

What I thought was fire

Was only the spark



The sweetest melody is an unheard refrain

So lower your sights

Yeah but raise your aim

Raise you aim



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target,

Blame Cupid, Cupid

You think you're smart

Stupid, Stupid.



CHORUS



""I thought you loved me but it seems you don't care.""

""I care enough to know I can never love you.""



Who broke my heart?

You did, you did

Bow to the target

Blame Cupid

You think you're smart

That's stupid

Right from the start

When you knew we would part

I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress

I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore

Trouble is I don't love you any less

I held you close to me one time I kissed your lips and called you mine

But another came and thrilled you more I guess

I'm not worried and I'm not dismayed

I never will run away

I won't fear the enemy

When they come at me they're gonna fall

For Your power will conquer all

There's just one place I wanna be



That place is....

One thing that I desire from the Lord

That one thing will I seek for

That I may dwell within His house

And inquire in His temple

And behold the beauty of the Lord



Fairest Lord Jesus

Ruler of all nature

Thou of God and Thou of man (and so beautiful)

Thee will I cherish

Thee will I honor Lord

Your my soul's glory, joy and crown

How I love and adore You

For Your beautiful beyond all description

2535,Dimmu Borgir,The Fundamental Alienation,angry,"My eyes got blinded 
And conned by the light 
Like a fugitive on the run 
I sought perseverance in the night 
Deceptive icons were finally 

Taken out of my sight 

As the contender to origin 

I will forever unveil His might 



They say I am the cancer 

On the back of the Inquisition 

I may well be the cancer 

On the heart of the Inquisition 



They say I am the cancer 

On the back of the Inquisition 

I am the cancer 

On the heart of the Inquisition 



Through my years of sacrifice 

Evolution came with lessons learned 

Respect and fear 

Is what I earned 

So underestimate not your vision 

Or you will be taught 

Calculate your intuition 

And you will teach 



You have all been conned 

And I always take the blame 

For you do not understand 

You are all the same"

Now she in the club with a freaky dress on

cats don't want her to keep that dress on

Tryin to get enough drinks in her system

Take it to the tele and make her a victim



Controlling the brain, ball play you in the face

They shake the spot, she's just another case

Got a girl at home but he don't care

Won't care (won't care)

All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go no-where

He thinks because I'm at home I won't be gettin it on

And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets

Chicks calling the house, no stop its

Getting out of control

finally I can't take no more

Because I met her on the stairs, saying this is the end

I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Isn't going down so well 
And this road that I have followed 
Is leading me to hell 
  
And you said it didn't matter 

But I think you're a liar 

Is this one of your talents 

That stokes the very 



Fire that burns you 

Each time you try to live

The earth will turn below you 

The pressure is building 

And something has to give 

  

And when I build you a steeple 

You say it's incomplete 

Cos you need the whole cathedral 

To satisfy your need 

  

You're like a paper aeroplane 

That never seems to land 

Flying blind through anything 

Straight into the 



Hand that chokes you 

Each time you try to live 

The earth will turn below you 

The pressure is building 

And something has to give 

  

Something has to give"

The helicopters
I'm in New York
No need for words now

In the eye directly

You met me

I think it's wednesday

The evening

The mess we're in

And ooooh...

Night and day

I dream of

Making love

Love making

On screen

Impossible dream

And I have seen

The sunrise over the river

The freeway

Reminding of

This mess we're in

And ooooh...

I just wanna say

Don't ever change now baby

I'd thank you

I don't think we will meet again

And you must leave now

Before the sun rises

Above the skycrapers

And the city landscape comes into view

Swell on my skin

Oh

Take back what was stolen

Reclaim all that's lost

With virtue, I will rise up from the ruins



C'mon!

Through adversity, there is redemption

With passion, fighting

I am unbroken

Through adversity, there is redemption

With passion, fighting

Take back what was stolen

Embrace the cycle

Refuse to turn back now and be led astray

Fear is failure

And this is my affirmation



Through adversity, there is redemption

With passion, fighting

I am unbroken

Through adversity, there is redemption

The absence of doubt, breeds desire

If there is truth to face

Upon the pain getting deeper

Though my love wants to relieve her.

She walks alone from wall to wall,



Lost in her hall she can't hear me,

Though I know she likes to be near me.

She sits in her corner by the door.

There must be more I can tell her

If she really wants me to help her.

And maybe one day I will free her

2558,Joe Jackson,Lullaby,sad,"Shall I stay or go
Through the door
Will the pen to flow
Watch the stars
Sleep's a chore

The moon is growing cold

It hangs like a sliver of tin

How do our dreams unfold

And why are my bones feeling thin



I watch my pen as though

My fingers could shatter like icicles

And before my eyes

Lie glittering and useless on a field of snow"
2559,Megadeth,The Killing Road,angry,"Again we stalk the stage
At mach speed we engage
Feeding people's rage
The big cat's left it's cage
Back in the bus again
To catch another plane

The behavior's quite insane

But we do it for the fame, yeah



I lost my mind, I lost all my money

I lost my life to the killing road



The road will never end

It always starts again

Another show's around the bend

Another long lost friend

Faceless as the snow

There's nothing special about the road

It's just another haul

It's just too damn long that's all, yeah"
2560,Willie Nelson,What a Wonderful World,relaxed,"I see trees of green red roses too I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white the bright blessed day the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by

I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do

They're really saying I love you

I hear babies cry I watch them grow they'll learn much more than I'll ever know

And I think to myself what a wonderful world

And I think to myself what a wonderful world"
2561,Black Sabbath,Sick and Tired,sad,"Got no time to be on the run,
Got no holes in my shoes,
You're the reasong all my friends have gone,
But I won't run from you.
So many promises, and you broke them all,

Oh I'll forgive, but I can't forget,

You know you're a fake, but I just can't take no more,

Cause I'm tired of it.



I'm so tired, so tired,

Sick and tired of it all,

I'm so tired, sick and tired,

I'm so tired, sick and tired of it all, yeah.



You turn the truth, then you turn your back,

You're a victim of yourself,

The hate remains, the hurting still exists.

I'm so tired of it all.



I'm so tired, sick and tired,

So damn tired, sick and tired of it all, oh yeah,

I'm so tired, I'M sick and tired of it all."

As I awake to greet the coming dawn

Then I wished that I could come back as a flower

As a flower

As a flower

How I wished that I could come back as a flower

As a flower

To spread the sweetness of love

To spread the sweetness of love



The dew had finished making love to many

A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air

I envied all the silence I saw growing

So unmoved by things outside themselves



Then how I wished that I could come back as a flower

How I wished that I could come back as a flower

As a flower

To spread the sweetness of love

The silverware is gone
The furniture is missing
I guess you got it all uhuh
This is where it ought to hurt
Seems like every time you leave me

You try to think of something worse



I can't even get the blues no more

I try to worry like I did before

And nothing happens when I walk the floor

So what am I supposed to do

I toss and turn but then I fall asleep

I'm going under but it's not too deep

You want to hurt me but it's just no use

I can't even get the blues



Well this time ain't no different

The sun's up in the sky

Sitting on the back porch

Clouds are rolling by

Oh this is where it ought to rain

But it doesn't really matter

To me it's all about the same



I can't even get the blues no more

I try to worry like I did before

And nothing happens when I walk the floor

So what am I supposed to do

I toss and turn but then I fall asleep

I'm going under but it's not too deep

You want to hurt me but it's just no use

I can't even get the blues

(You try and hurt me)



I can't even get the blues no more

I try to worry like I did before

And nothing happens when I walk the floor

You want to hurt me but it's just no use

I can't even get the blues"

How I wondered where I'd go
While the blizzards,
cold wind and snow
Pounded outside my window.

California sunset

Going down in the West

All the colors in the sky

Kiss another day goodbye.



Land of beauty,

space and light

Land of promise,

land of might

You're my home now

and it's true

California, here's to you.

Kiss another day goodbye.

Eliminate the poor, how much longer will it take
Burning up the tents of the rank and file
Exterminate their lives, crack a demon smile
Crushing down, caving in our will to live

Getting rid of man's mistakes

To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down

How much more can we take



Fight for freedom, fight authority

Fight for anything, my country tis' of me



Cty for absolution, it's not hte end for me

A last minute pardon, one final reprieve

Resist the war machine, don't get in it's path

Fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath

Getting rid of man's mistakes

To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down

How much more can we take

Remorseless anarchy

I am arrogance in the flesh

Unleashed intensity 



Step aside for the nightmare

Pure destruction stands before you

No escape as the psycho

Brings you misery

The line starts here 



I am brutality the face of everlasting pain

Annihilation, Obliteration

Pulses in these veins

Sheer defiance drives my hostility

I am merciless to the core

Chaotic fury breeds 



Step aside for the nightmare

Pure destruction stands before you

No escape as the psycho

Brings you misery

The line starts here 



Bring it all on

Come and take on what you fear

I'm the storm

That towers overhead

Ticking time bomb

With an infinite charge

Bringer of torture

The master is here

Everyone falls 



Here comes the pain

You're no different from the rest

Victim is your name in my vicious wasteland

Here comes the pain

Your destruction manifests

Lying there broken looking up as I still stand 



Bring it all on

Come and take on what you fear

I'm the storm

That towers overhead

Ticking time bomb

With an infinite charge

Bringer of torture

The master is here

Everyone falls"

You're everything I need
You are so beautiful to nobody but me



Such joy and happiness you bring

Such joy and happiness you bring

Like a dream you're everything, I I hoped for

You're everything that I need



And you are so beautiful

You are just beautiful to me

You are how to explain, that

So this is Xmas

And what have you done

Another year over

And a new one just begun

And so this is Xmas

I hope you have fun

The near and the dear one

The old and the young



A very Merry Xmas

And a happy New Year

Let's hope it's a good one

Without any fear



And so this is Xmas

For weak and for strong

For rich and the poor ones

The world is so wrong

And so happy Xmas

For black and for white

For yellow and red ones

Let's stop all the fight



A very Merry Xmas

And a happy New Year

Let's hope it's a good one

Without any fear



And so this is Xmas

And what have we done

Another year over

A new one just begun

And so happy Xmas

We hope you have fun

The near and the dear one

The old and the young



A very Merry Xmas

And a happy New Year

Let's hope it's a good one

Without any fear

War is over, if you want it

War is over now



Happy Xmas"
2578,Slayer,Ghosts of War,angry,"[Lyrics: King; Music: Hanneman, King]
Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise.
Once forgotten soldiers come to life.
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done,
Not content with wars we never won.



Memories can't ignore

Anguish of before

Satisfy the scorn.

Rise ghosts of war.



Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.

Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die.

Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny

Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie.



(Memories can't ignore

Anguish of before

Satisfy the scorn.

Rise ghosts of war.)



[LEADS: HANNEMAN, KING, HANNEMAN]



I deal in pain.

All life I drain.

I dominate.

I seal your fate.

I deal in pain.

All life I drain.

Memories can't ignore,

Rise ghost of war."

Love was made for me and you

And I might introduce her to mack me
Told my homeboy I was scoping hoping
To crack them legs wide open
Ready to break that banging ass
Get it with the shad

Take a bath in her mouth yeah

Better keep the trojan

And if the sex was good still be the whole frame

Fucked around and told my plan to the man

Sitting next to the god damn men

How was I to know son

That the nigg' blow with one and told the 4-1-1

With a big fat grand

Talking 'bout all the whores that I ran up in

Broke a nigga plan like dishes

Cuz now the bitch is getting suspicious

She know I fuck whores outa habit

Who framed Cube, mothafuck Roger Rabbit!

Cuz I couldn't have and got stabbed in the back

By a black ass dirty mack...



[CHORUS:]



And if you didn't know it's like that

I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack

Yeah nigga didn't you know it was like that

I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack...



There goes the bill-board pull it

And see up I'm still #1 with the bullet

what the fuck do I sing?

It looks like the Predator

it's gettin dissed by the editor

Looked up and hell of white for caper

It's to lynch a nigga on paper

But I'm much too black for the god damn cracker

Huh! Dirty Macker

Even the Guardian Angel got mental

But never seen their ass walking past South Central

Little super hair oh don't lemme catcha

I fuck around and wetcha

Try to dirty mack me out

Try to take food out my kids mouth

You're looking at my people are stronger than your evil

All you ask where they got the hip hop

At the dope the 187 taxi on your toe

So act like you know

That nigga that's known to jack

Devils in little red hats

Motherfuckin dirty macks!



[CHORUS]



Don't come to an O.G., with that 'he said she said'

Bitch, hit the freeway, dirty mack's get tossed

Cuz I fuck around, and jump your ass like Kris Kross

Just might blast, snake in the grass

Gotta shake up the ass

Found at a trunk of funk

Tall and stiff as a philly blunt

What more do you want you unfucked up the plot

And deserve just what you got

Cuz I'm hotter than tabasco

You little ass hole

Mow I gotta do you like grass chow

PKO now you see they flow on cannabis

Cause you scandalous

Don't know who the man is

Ice Cube a jack

The white ass Dirt Mack

I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack

Yo Savage didn't you know it was like that
